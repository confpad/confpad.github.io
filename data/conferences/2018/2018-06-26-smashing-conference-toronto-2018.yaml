    You may have heard about CSS Variables (aka CSS Custom Properties), but think it’s not something you can use yet. Plus, you already have your preprocessor pipeline in place, why should you care? This talk will show how CSS Variables are much more powerful than static preprocessor variables and can be used today without compromising progressive enhancement. You will also learn several creative tips and tricks to take full advantage of them. As is customary with Lea’s CSS talks, expect a swath of live demos to demonstrate the material.

    In this talk, Sarah will start with only an Illustrator document and by the end, make it move! It's not clear what exactly will move and how- this is something she and the audience will discover together. The talk will be completely unique- the plan will not be set in stone. She'll live-code (warts and all) and you'll see her process as she'll animate an SVG in the time allotted. She'll optimize, work with styles, and create an animation with javascript, and even ask for audience participation at times to decide what happens next. Come watch for a one-time show!

    Sketching is a great tool for designers (well, actually for anyone who needs to think about complex problems and communicate with others) to have in their skill set. It’s fast, efficient and everybody can do it. Everybody? Yes, everybody… even you. In this hands-on session, Eva-Lotta will show you some basic techniques to start sketching your ideas. You'll get some hands-on practice on how to sketch simple pictures to inject into your everyday notes and work. She’ll show examples of how easy-to-do sketches can help make your thoughts clearer, your notes more structured and your communication more engaging. You are invited to sketch along, learn-by-doing right in the session and walk away with a neat little visual vocabulary that you can use straight away in meetings, workshops or your secret notebook. If you think you are rubbish at sketching and want to get a fun kick-start to getting into using pen and paper (again), this session will be just right for you.

    As a graphic designer, I'm lucky to make things for all kinds of things. But more and more, I'm realizing the profound impact it has on the things in the rest of my life. Things in my backyard. Things that holds things. Things on the open road. Things in my bank account. Things for my nephew. Things for people I'll never meet. And things on one of the saddest days of my life. That's a lot of things. Plus, we'll update you on all the things we've been up to, aside from all these things. Tons of new things to talk about!

    Many teams still find themselves struggling to make the switch from icon fonts to SVG. SVG icon systems seem more complex and require a different workflow. But even though some techniques do, there are many options available for creating and embedding SVG icons systems that I'm sure everyone — regardless of their workflow — will find one that works for them. For example, did you know there are 3 different ways to create and embed SVG sprites? In this talk based on some of the content from my very popular SVG Coffee Cup worksho, I'm going to cover all available SVG spriting techniques and embedding techniques, creating SVG icon systems using all 3 different techniques. You'll learn the pros and cons of each one, so you can make a better informed decision when choosing your way to SVG icon adoption.

    The amount of data that is being gathered in the world is only growing. And since humans are visual beings we need to see the data to understand patterns, trends and outliers. It's no wonder then that we're only seeing a rise in the number of data visualizations used on the web these days. Thankfully for Nadieh, making data visual is one of the things she likes doing the most. And during this talk Nadieh will show you how to create a unique, effective (& even beautiful) chart using d3.js, which has become the main "tool" for doing (interactive) data visualization online. Starting from an empty white browser window she'll code & take you through all the nuts and bolts that go into creating a chart with d3, and how, with a little bit of out-of-the-box thinking you can use SVG in the weirdest ways to get what you had envisioned.

    Organising CSS in a project can be tricky, especially if you want to create fallbacks for newer CSS such as Grid Layout, fallbacks which can rely on your CSS being in a particular order to take advantage of the cascade. The solution is to develop a pattern library first, to create structured components which can then be compiled into a stylesheet before deployment. And, by making the Pattern Library your build environment — it remains the source of truth, never becoming separate from the CSS deployed on the site. In this talk, Rachel will be looking at some interesting Grid Layout tricks, in the context of a real-life pattern library built using Fractal. She’ll show you how I structure components, in order to create robust fallbacks for older browsers while fully taking advantage of things that would be impossible without Grid
