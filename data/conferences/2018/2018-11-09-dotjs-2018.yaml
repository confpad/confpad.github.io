    It goes without saying that one of the largest challenges in JavaScipt is handling asynchronicity. Along come Async / Await, a language feature made popular by C#. Developers can now use the keyword await to write code in a synchronous fashion without blocking the main thread. The only catch is that the await keyword needs to be used in an async function. What if that were not the case? What if await could be used anywhere inside a JavaScript module? Myles follows the adventure of implementing the Top-Level await feature in the JavaScript language. From deep dives into module loading to a high level overview of socializing standards changes, he covers the process of what it takes to change the JavaScript language.

Devs who are never going to build a runtime will learn a bit about how they work, which will hopefully help them build better JS apps!

    With many new technologies, although we’re excited about the new possibilities, we don’t get around to actually using them in real applications for many months or years. We’ve now seen this with HTTP/2 which was released in 2015 but is still working its way into our software today, over three years later. Tara looks into how far we’ve come in the past three years with HTTP/2 and what is actually at our disposal as developers.

Through an animated cartoon environment, Joost shows various sync and async concepts.

    Sometimes, undefined is not a function. As mortal programmers, we ship bugs to production everyday. Bugs slow us down, frustrate our users, and cause us to have crises of confidence. Don't go alone–type systems in technologies such as TypeScript, Flow, and GraphQL can improve your confidence and help you ship less bugs. Lauren dives into the practical benefits you'll get from embracing types. You'll walk away with a better understanding of why type systems help you write better programs, and some functional programming tips you can use today.
