      There will always be a new JavaScript framework to learn. Technology will continue to evolve and change, and developers will continue to rewrite applications. Wouldnt it be amazing if we could just copy paste 90% of our code from framework to framework?Well, you can. Reactive programming enables just this AND the ability to future proof your code.Not only can reactive programming help with your solutions to JavaScript fatigue, but the concepts and technology remain consistent from framewrk to framework.Learn how to create a more composable application architecture and an arsenal of lego bricks with RxJS, a push based primitive and domain specific language that sits on top of JavaScript.

      Many teams have been discussing on whether to go the immutable or mutable state route. Flux or MVC or MVVM? Redux, MobX or Apollo? Instead of answering the question, in this talk we will look at JavaScript code on a more fundamental level How do data structures work in JavaScript. What assumptions can be we make if we treat them to be immutable? Or mutable? How can we express concepts like identities, references, collections, mutations, derivations in either case? And can we bent the rules between the two? This talk will provide you a deeper understanding of the difference between state and data. A deeper understanding of JavaScript itself. Which will help you to improve the state you manage, regardless of the library you use to implement that.

      D3 and React, who should control the DOM? After all, React’s whole purpose is managing updates to the DOM so we don’t have to. D3, on the other hand, is a library for building data visualizations, and it too needs access to the DOM. And stepping back, when should we even use D3 and React together? In this talk, I will give guidelines on when React should have ownership of the DOM, and when D3 should instead. More importantly, I will cover the interactions and applications that will benefit the most from using D3 and React, together.

      As the popularity of GraphQL grows, many hard questions are being asked by companies adopting it as an API standard. What databases or search engines can I use it with? How do you aggregate data from multiple sources globally? Can GraphQL fetched data be available offline, and if clients mutate it how are conflicts resolved? Is there a secure way to control data access based on user authentication? Do subscriptions scale to thousands or millions of users? How do I use it with content like images or video? We’ll learn about AWS AppSync, a managed GraphQL service with offline and realtime features, and see the latest features and functionality that have just been released to market.

With React v16.0 Facebook has completely revised the internals of React while keeping the public API essentially the same.Learn about what’s new in React 16 which would include a brief explanation of the new algorithm along with focus on few of the new features like Error Boundaries, Portals, Fragments and SSR with React 16.

      This talk will focus on the creative exploitation of React component architecture to render not only to DOM elements, but other targets as well, at the same time. We will explore techniques you can use to achieve this, common pitfalls, useful applications of these patterns and not so useful, but wildly entertaining applications of these patterns.

      As apps begin to scale, many developers find themselves asking the question - but where does all the hard stuff go? The complicated data manipulation, the validation, the process flow of our apps. In other words, the business logic. If React is designed for the view layer, and we’re using Redux or something similar for the state, then where does the business logic go? This talk looks at the different options and tries to answer that question.

      React is a component-based UI library that doesn’t provide any built-in components. Over the years companies and developers have invested a lot of time and money in development of UI components based on VanillaJS or various frameworks. Building components is time consuming, has integration and maintenance risks, and worst of all, distracts developers from the task at hand - actually building the application. In this presentation, you will learn how to quickly and easily “Reactify” your existing JavaScript components to use them in React applications.

      Reprocessing is a new library for Reason, a rather new programming language building on the OCaml + JavaScript ecosystems. It’s a lean wrapper around OpenGL and WebGL and allows truly cross-platform games to be written rather easily.Reason is great for a whole lot of things, but let me take you through a story of trying to write a 2D physics engine in just under 8 hours (Mistakes were made), what strongly typed languages don’t protect you off, and a vision of what you could build with Reason or Reprocessing. The universal future is coming, and Reason is orienting itself just right with projects like bsb-native.
