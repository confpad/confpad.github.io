      Design systems and pattern libraries help designers and developers to get a common understanding of user interfaces. But even with such tools in place, there's a ton of processes and handovers involved. Each one causing possible friction and information loss. Especially over time. This might lead to new features feeling outdated on release, and screens and mock-ups getting too old too fast.With our recent move to Angular and Sketch, we were able to automate 70% of our UI development. Helping our developers to focus on the real problems, and reducing the UI review efforts tremendously. Join us and see how we produce a single source of truth for developers and designers, and how we are able to consume this source in our tool of choice.

      There are many exciting things happening with AI, from which, until recently, JavaScript developers were largely shut out. But things are changing, if you can do `npm install @tensorflow/tfjs` or make an API call, you can now do AI.In this fast-paced talk, I'll open your mind to what's possible by demoing several AI-powered JavaScript apps and show you how I built them using either TensorFlow.js or easy to use AI powered APIs.You don't need a PhD in Maths, you don't need years of experience, you just need imagination and the willingness to try.

      NgRx is a Redux-inspired framework for Angular applications. It manages state and side effects, helping you build applications that are easier to test, strongly typed and more performant; however, these benefits can add complexity. Luckily, there are a set of hard rules and principles that will guide you through these tradeoffs.

      Many apps can install ngUpgrade and begin rewriting components, but it's not so easy when those components make up a library that is used by several teams to power their production apps. Instead of rewriting everything at once, this talk shares how we first created a common interface with custom elements, and then upgraded one component at a time to Angular Elements.

    description: |-
      Change detection is the key area affecting an application’s performance. It’s where most of the optimization efforts like using OnPush strategy are put. But using optimization strategies without solid understanding of the change detection process is tricky and can cause inconsistent behavior. Also insufficient knowledge often leads to a painful experience when debugging Change Detection errors, like ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked. In this talk, I'll use simple concise examples to present the change detection mechanism under the hood. We’ll also take a look at how an existing implementation has been improved in Ivy. By the end of the talk, you’ll have enough knowledge to choose the right optimization technique and even come up with new techniques yourself. What you’ll learn from the talk will also help you debug change detection errors much faster and fix them in a proper way.

      Traditionally, we've built web apps with little more than a few files scattered around the disk. Then came development servers, and transpilers, and assemblers, and everything was a mess of plugins. This talk walks you through what a build system is, how it helps you organize your software development flow, and what properties to look for in a good build system.

      There is no doubt that 2018 is the YearOfPWA. It’s the year when Progressive Web Apps will get the really broad adoption and recognition by all the involved parties: browser vendors (finally, all the major ones), developers, users. Angular developers are lucky to have some really nice options to automate their PWA’s main functionality exposed by Service Worker API. The first option is 100% native to the Angular and created by the Angular team: Angular Service Worker. The second one is a framework-agnostic library called Workbox.Both approaches are robust, convenient and unique! Let’s go through the main features of PWA implemented using NGSW vs Workbox and the resulting application lifecycle management. After the session, everyone will give their own answer on what’s easier to start with, which library is simpler to use, which resulting PWA is more convenient to maintain.

      Dependency Injection is at the heart of Angular. We don't even think about it too much — we ask for a dependency, we get it. However, once our app grows and we have multiple NgModules, lazy loading and use third party components, things start to get more complex. In this session, you will learn about ElementInjector and ModuleInjector, how they work together, and the two-pass dependency resolution process. Did we mention it is going to be fun? 💉🌲

      Nowadays, we build large enterprise applications with Angular. But how to best structure such projects to ensure long-term maintainability and reusability?This session provides multiple answers to this question. We explore how to split large projects into individually reusable npm packages and how to deploy them through an internal and public registry. As an alternative, we discuss the Monorepo approach that is used successfully by big companies like Google and Facebook and which compensates for some of the disadvantages of npm packages in internal projects.The use of micro apps is also discussed and implementation options, advantages and disadvantages are investigated. By the end the audience will know the options for architecting enterprise apps.

      Most Angular applications need to customize their display, features and behaviour depending on multiple and complex criteria serving different use cases like white-labeling, A/B testing or progressive deployment.In this talk, I will show you how to architect your Angular apps by providing loosely coupled and interchangeable components that will allow you or even your applications’ end-users to customize the application experience dynamically by simple configuration (and without any switch/case).

      The main use-case for using dynamic components is when we can decide only in run-time which component is loaded. They’re also the only solution when we want to embed Angular components in non-Angular ones. In many cases, replacing in-template components with dynamic ones is beneficial to performance and code quality. In this talk, we’ll learn how to create and use dynamic components, and discuss several types of usages.

      With the new rendering engine (Ivy) we’ve finally been able to work on a full revamp of i18n (internationalization) for Angular. Translations are now handled at runtime which brings a lot of benefits: one bundle for all languages, service for code translations…In this talk, we will review the design choices, the changes and the benefits of this new approach.

      Web, Mobile & Desktop are the 3 standard platforms we develop for today especially in the Enterprise world. Each platform has its own unique features and needs. When faced with requirements where we need to develop one application for all 3, it can be a nightmare to get it right. How do you share code effectively? How do we solve a white labelling requirement? In this talk, I will show you based on a real-world Enterprise Healthcare application on how Angular can be the glue for such a monumental task where we will end up with a Mobile Solution, A Web Responsive Solution as well as a Desktop solution with electron while using 100% the same code base.
