      In a fast-moving development organization, with each new build, there’s a plausible risk that the product might have somehow got worse. To address that risk, testers often find themselves responsible for—and overwhelmed by—the development and maintenance of an ever-growing automated regression test suite. Is this the best use of the testers’ time? Are the testers in the ideal position to do this well? What about the other forms of product and project risk—the problems that aren’t related to regression? Michael Bolton identifies factors to consider when linking the risk of regression to your overall testing strategy.

      Automated testing is a big rarity in GameDev. The Product is very specific and it is easier to test it manually… Frequent changes of the product… Lack of technologies to start automation from scratch. There are a lot of excuses why we don’t do automated testing in GameDev. But what if you spend tons of time in regression testing, again and again you need to click every UI element before a new release or a patch? The talk is about automated testing of games in Unity3D. How we automated our UI testing, why we decided to write our own UnityDriver and how we did it. And finally I will share with you small tips and tricks that might be helpful in your automation

      Testing is still developing, and mobile testing in particular. What is included in the performance of the mobile application and what metrics can be distinguished? How does Charles help with performance testing? Are Monkey Exerciser, Android Profiler, and Battery Historian only developer tools or the best friends of the testers in the non-functional testing of the mobile application? The purpose of my report is to talk about common invisible problems, which affect the quality of mobile applications, but which are often forgotten in the testing process.

      Modern software development is impossible without efficient tools. Quality assurance and especially browser automation is not an exclusion. When your team grows you will need more and more browsers being run in parallel. Well known Selenium server and Selenium Grid architecture are known to become slow and unstable even with several dozens of running browsers. Ggr is lightweight solution proven to work in a big cluster with thousands of parallel browser sessions. This talk will cover in detail Ggr - an extremely efficient Selenium load balancer absolutely necessary when you need to have more than several dozens of browsers running in parallel. We will begin with Selenium load balancing basics and go through all important Ggr features. You will see for example how easy is to show live browser screen and download recorded video for any browser session from hundreds of Selenium hosts.

      Whenever you are planning to do something big - you need to account for risks that something may break you plans. Be it late arrival to the airport of broken demo environment. Risks are all around us and we need to accept this and learn how to live in a peaceful harmony with them. There are different things you can try to play with risks, and there are different outcomes you may wish to achieve. So let's see how to apply them in different cases and get the best ROI from risk management (or even just risk definition)

      Testing is hard. Despite all read tutorials and courses not everyone is following the TDD approach. The idea looks nice in general but brings pain on implementation. What is wrong with our testing? Let’s find out! This talk will be interesting for frontend and backend developers as we will look into: - what makes effective tests - three qualities of tests - how not to mix specification and implementation in tests - how to predict future and work following ATDD - how to write end to end tests with CodeceptJS

      Today, no one is surprised by highly loaded systems. Moreover, few people in our industry can be surprised by a separate person who is engaged in stress testing. Most of them think if they can automate everything, then the tests would find bugs automatically. However, few people know that the most significant part of the time is spent on analyzing the results (logs and graphs). The speech is going to show how to reduce the time to find bottlenecks in the analysis of various logs. How can you apply the simplest models of machine learning to find bottlenecks? Moreover, how to get requirements using historical data.

      Automatic tests — the only objective and operative source of information about true quality of a software product under development. Modern applications are very complex, and it is impossible to estimate quality with needed coverage manually. Sometimes we have only subjective opinions about quality: "it seems it is working", "smoke tests are passing — well, let's release". In the given talk, we discuss a method to examine quality of a software product. This method enables everyone to measure work results of developers, and make release decisions based on facts, not opinions.

      It’s been a year since the second version of Allure was released. During this time the number of tests has drastically increased, we started using new tools and learned to visualize information about the quality of our tests. All these changes had an impact on Allure, so now we’ve released a new major version of our test report. This talk will be useful both for those who are not familiar with Allure test report and for active users. We’ve added lots of new features. Come and join the talk!

      In recent years, words Agile and Scrum have ceased to be exotic not only in IT, but also outside software development. Such approaches propagate with the speed of a zombie apocalypse in horror movies.Requests for Scrum workshops come from increasingly exotic types of business. What is the difference between the implementation of Scrum / Agile in IT and outside? What are the difficulties, and which insights / "improvements" are noticed by teams and company executives? What is the secret of such popularity? You can hear about this and many other cases from our own experience with such companies as Intertop, Pandora, Amway, Weatherford, Kuehne + Nagel, NashFormat, Prozorro (and some others). Should be interesting and positive as usual. See you!

      How good is your testing? Do you know? And if you do, can you explain why? One way to measure the success of your testing is to compare the information you now have about your product, to the information you intended to gather when you started testing. That intention is what your test strategy should capture and communicate. That last word is important: communicate. Even the best testing in the world isn't worth anything if you can't communicate what you're going to do, what you've done, and why. In this presentation I will show how I think about, model and visualize a strategy that is useful and that lets me later assess how well testing is fulfilling its mission, whether it's for hands-on testing that I'm doing to do on that particular day, or if I'm managing a multi-site project with cross-functional agile teams and need to construct a high-level starting point for test planning for the coming 6 months. Furthermore, I will discuss how to divide the strategy work between different project members and how to make sure that the quality assessments and reporting can be made valuable and, above all else, actionable by the project manager and product owners. This talk is directed at all types of project members, managers and other stakeholders who works with product quality.

Hope it will help you to avoid common mistakes, burnout, gloom and oblivion in test automation.

Well, as usual, I accompany my reports not only with theory but also with practical examples. times the special guests will be: - Nmap - Metasploit - Ettercap

      The perspective of creating a mobile app that doesn’t need to be downloaded and reviewed in the App Store is very attractive, especially when there is more than one analog for installable apps: Progressive Web Apps (PWA), Android Instant Apps (AIA) and Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). But here there is no silver bullet: each of the mentioned technologies has its own peculiarities of development, support, and testing. In the lecture, we’ll explore each of the platforms in detail and compare them with “usual” mobile apps, so to be ready for quality assurance even in such new and unusual projects

It solves problems of interactive visualization of collected metrics, storing historical data, errors cause analysis, comparing several tests etc. Used open-source tools: Apache Jmeter, Grafana, Influxdb, Telegraf, Sitespeed.io, Jenkins, Webpagetest. All these services are wrapped into docker containers, that allows you to up the framework in just a few minutes. More examples can be found in the readme at https://github.com/serputko/performance-testing-framework.

      The cheapest way to develop is the one where the artifacts are delivered to users in ONE iteration. Without 10+ iterations of improvements due to errors found. We will talk about the shift left testing approach that is gaining popularity. Its purpose is to prevent the occurrence of errors instead of searching for mistakes already made in the software. Testing with a left shift assumes that testing and development work in tandem and as the name suggests, testing is carried forward to the earliest stages of development. - You will learn why you need to test requirements and documentation. And also consider what engineering practices help make this a part of the culture in the team. (code review, pull request, spec by example, bdd, atdd) - I'll talk about different kinds of automated tests and when to write them, in order to reduce the number of manual tests in the late stages of product development. (tdd, bdd, atdd, component and integration tests) - We will analyze how joint team activities and functional duties of each team member change to conform this methodology. (Planning, grooming, retrospective, demo, dsm, compiling a test strategy, planning testing). - I will tell why it is so important to design the test models using test-design practices, rather than relying solely on exploratory testing. We will look at the testing of control flow, cycles, data flows. I will show practical examples of why developers need to master the skills of test design. - In conclusion, I will tell about one of the ways to calculate test coverage and how it differs from code coverage. As an example, we will draw a graph of requirements and check the coverage of the test model. The entire talk will be done with the example of testing a very simple application, consisting of a single service, a database and a WEB-page. Shift left testing underlies the Agile and DevOps methodologies.

      It's XXI century out and the Internet entangle everyone tighter day by day. Can you imagine spending at least a couple of hours with no chats, mail, social networks? I bet you do. But did you ever think how fragile the web is? What if there are not so much efforts required to bring everything down? What is the chance to see ""500 Internal Server Error"" on opening your favorite website for a new portion of cute kitties? This talk is about HTTP vulnerabilities that impede our e-life. They require minimal uplink to cause denial of service. And they are the risk you need to be aware of to be on the safe side We will look into different types of attacks, find their similarities and differences. Dive into internal mechanics of the attacks, find out why it is possible and how does it work. We will also learn to test web projects for these types of vulnerabilities and mitigate the risks. And for sure, we'll find a peaceful use for the approaches that will come handy for engineers involved in web projects.

      Testing provides the headlights for the project—but where should those headlights be pointed? In a car, the headlights are naturally pointed towards the road ahead, but on a software development project, we don't always know where precisely where we're headed. Problems directly in front of us pose a risk to the business... but where else might risk threaten the value of the product or the project? In this presentation (co-authored with James Bach), Michael Bolton takes a deep dive into the relationship between testing, problems, and risk. He'll offer an approach to looking at the risk story, and the factors that inform it, and he'll provide you with a set of ideas to help you develop a risk model for your project.

      Test design techniques is the ‘maths’ of testing. New techniques appear not so often. Two years ago the book of Cem Kaner ‘The Domain Testing Workbook’ was published. Let’s investigate the domain testing technique and try to identify whether this is something new in test design. What domain tetsing has in common with other test design technique? We will also analyse several examples of how to use domain testing tehnique in real project.

      Our product's main concept is understanding the live human language via Natural Language Processing = NLP to build chatbots for US insurance companies. Primarily, the Neural network did that for us. But when our chatbots got smarter, the approach needed to be continuously upgraded to avoid trolling the hooman. I'll be happy to share some practice of how our dev team improved our product in terms of NLP... and a few funny moments when users got the harsh dialog with our AI

      Almost any application or software system manages data. It is hard to imagine test automation that is not affected by this fact. There are many differenct approaches how to prepare system under test, providing predefined test data: use application UI, invoke API methods, run business logic directly, access DB from test scenarios, etc. In this talk we will review most of existing approaches, starting from the easiest and the most popular ones and finishing with really tricky ways to manage your test data for large distributed systems. There is no ideal solution for every case or silver bullet, but I hope your toolset will become wider after visiting this talk.
