Can your users access information your application provides? Do you really need server-side rendering to be successful? In this talk we’ll cover answers to these questions as well as gotchas and real-world stories from running angular.io, a client-side-only PWA visited by over a 1 million unique visitors each month.

    You just finished your awesome component only to realize it is dog slow! While there are a number of things that could be causing this, the most common is calling functions from your template. These function get evaluated every time change detection run and can be a real ng-buzzKill. In most cases, changing that function to a pipe can get your app’s performance back on track. I’ll talk about both why functions slow down your app, and why/how pipes make it faster.

Using a simple application, this talk will demonstrate how Angular uses a compiler to merge all modules into a single injector. We’ll learn where lazy loaded modules fit into this picture and why modules hierarchy and encapsulation simply don’t exist at runtime. By the end of the talk, you’ll have enough knowledge to avoid unexpected results and will be able to link, load or compile modules like a pro.

    Angular is built from the ground up as a multi-platform JavaScript framework. You can use Angular to build an app for almost any environment. In this talk, we will go over a “real world”, open source app built in Angular that renders on 3 different platforms: the browser (i.e. your typical web app), the server (via Angular Universal) and native mobile (via NativeScript). Learn from two of the leading pioneers in Angular multi-platform development to establish a solid set of pros and cons to various approaches in project setup and organization. Don’t go wandering down the rabbit hole any longer but rather find the light at the end of the tunnel in this talk.

In this talk, I will live code the standard test app for PWAs “The Hacker News PWA”. I will show you how to build an impressive app by using the angular worker modules to score a 100 on progressive web app audit and also how to customize the worker to fit the needs of your specific application. Hacker News PWA or HN-PWA is the modern gold standard for comparing performance and usability across various PWAs built with different JS frameworks. This talk will take a step-by-step approach of converting a regular app to an Angular PWA and then challenge the browser audit tool to score a max on PWA, Performance, Accessibility and best practices. This is more of a code show than a talk show – Buckle up as we take an information intensive fun-filled ride to the amazing world of progressive web apps with Angular!

Snapshot testing allows us to quickly validate our UI when given a deterministic state. Snapshot testing also allows us to validate our reducers post state quickly and easily. This 20-minute talk is a great overview on how to quickly integrate jest.js into our angular-cli app, what files to check in, and how to write tests that effectively validate state and ui rendering.

    It often starts simply. You add an input field for a name, perhaps you add some validations for a password, and then suddenly, you’re grappling with nested forms and dynamic data. To create a smooth user experience, the form spans over multiple pages, where the user can save/reset her progress at each step. This simple form has transformed into a formidable beast. For this presentation, I will start with a simple, prepared reactive form that allows users to create a role-playing character similar to ones you would find in Dungeons and Dragons. The form will slowly grow in complexity with a nested form and dynamic data. In order to get the most out of this talk, you should have basic familiarity with Angular’s reactive forms, HTTP calls, and the D&D 5e compendium (I’m kidding on the last one). As long as you know how to write a reactive form with an input field and a submit button that makes a post request upon being clicked, then you should be fine. Participants may also choose to clone my github repo, so they may explore and experiment with the character form. May it serve as a reference for future form-building endeavors or perhaps as inspiration for a revolutionary role-playing game. Just send me 15% royalties.

    This talk is a deep dive into how to handle complex forms using ngrx. We will start out with several use cases in our sample app that typically cause problems such as race conditions, dynamic forms, and duplicated data. This presentation is a combination of slides explaining use cases, core concepts, and possible solutions. I will be moving between the slides and live coding to show the problem conditions and then fix the problem by restructuring or modifying the code. The reason I believe this is very important to the community is because we have lots of talks/examples at the 50,000 ft level, but few examples of how to handle real-world problems. Everyone wants to learn more about ngrx and hw to implement complex forms while understanding how to avoid some of the common pitfalls we often run into.

    Angular is impressively fast. However, in some situations, for instance, when building complex enterprise applications, this is insufficient. In these cases, Angular provides several approaches to dramatically increasing performance. This workshop shows how to use these possibilities by means of a systematically optimized application. Attendees learn how to leverage Ahead-of-Time Compilation (AOT), Tree Shaking, the Build Optimizer, whitespace removal and Lazy Loading to improve the startup performance of their own applications dramatically. The OnPush optimization strategy to speed up data binding performance in your solutions is also demonstrated. Furthermore, Service Worker for caching and instant loading is covered, as well as Server-Side Rendering to improve the perceived loading time.

    Let’s face it, doing advanced work with RxJS is just plain tough. Sure, some of the simpler operators are easy to grok, but once we get beyond simple maps and subscribes, it doesn’t take much to just give up and go back to where things are comfortable. This is a shame because there’s a whole world of streamy goodness that, for many developers, is just around the corner. Writing advanced RxJS requires that we know its operators. There’s arguably no better way to get to know them than by writing our very own. In this workshop we’ll dig into RxJS by crafting our own operators. This will be hugely beneficial for you because, to do so, we’ll really need to get to know some of the more advanced native operators. If you want to become an RxJS Jedi by getting to know RxJS inside and out, this workshop is for you.

    Do you want to have full control over your Angular app? Maybe the CLI isn’t a good fit for your project? Are you pulling your hair out waiting for Webpack to bundle? Then this workshop may be for you! This workshop is from 12 – 1:50 pm. In this session, you will learn how to architect a custom Angular build. We will write a NodeJS script that AOT compiles and bundles an app. You’ll learn how to use the AOT compiler for development and production and see the benefits of optimizing with Closure Compiler. By the end of the workshop, you will have the tools to be able to implement your own custom build script for Angular. Bring a laptop with NodeJS > 8.0.0 && < 9.0.0 and the latest Java SE JDK installed to get the most out of this workshop. You will not need to know any Java! We are writing our build scripts with NodeJS. Java SE JDK is necessary to run Closure Compiler in the last step of the workshop and if you don’t have it installed, no worries you’ll still learn a lot about writing a custom build! For the best experience, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies prior to the workshop. There will be time, in the beginning, to catch up if you haven’t cloned the repo yet.

    Many organizations that have AngularJS applications in production face a tough choice: stay put and miss all the advances that Angular has to offer, or start the migration journey that is often no easier than rewriting the entire application. While there are online documentation and tutorials that describe the general migration process, they are often too high level to be practical, or too tedious to follow with multiple manual steps. Migrating a large code base requires a lot of resources and commitment, and doing everything manually is a non-starter. This is when tooling can be a big help. This talk will walk through a migration example, showcasing Angular Copilot, an Electron based tool for teams to plan, manage, and automate the migration process.

    We’ve all been there. Staring at VSCode. Paralyzed by one agonizing question. How do I structure my NgRx Store?! Should I add a new property for “totalLength”? Should I really store the width of this re-sized div? Is a “leftPanel” object really a good idea? As your application gets bigger, your store can turn unwieldy. What was once a simple array of todos is now a junk drawer of values. Adding just one property can break hundreds of tests. Dispatching new actions can cause needlessly trigger Change Detection, degrading performance, and creating some serious jank. New team members creating new Feature Modules can cause collisions with the store structure. This frustration is enough to make you `rm -rf` and go home. Fear not. There’s an easy solution: selectors. Selectors are the best-kept secret in NgRx. They allow you compute state from your store, which acts like a view model. This removes computed properties from the store and into their rightful place: a simple function. Selectors are easily tested, memoized for performance, and compose-able for re-usability. Selectors are easy to create and work well with teams. We’ve used them in high traffic production apps like the Firebase Console. Grab a seat. By the end of this talk you’ll shake any Store structure fears you once had and move forward boldly with selectors.

    The Component Dev Kit is a collection of robust, well-tested, versatile and performant APIs that 7 are the foundation of the Angular Material component library. It is written and maintained by the Material team and is intended to be a tool for building everything from small, one-off components, to complex UI libraries that are shared across teams and products. The CDK abstracts away all the complexities around areas such as content projection, positioning, accessibility, directionality, selection, and gestures, allowing you to write components that look great and behave consistently across devices.In this workshop we’ll go through the available APIs, as well as hands-on examples of how you can leverage the CDK in your own projects to build components like dialogs, form controls, menus, tooltips and much more, without having to re-invent the wheel.

    Do you know all the tools Angular gives you to work with DOM? You may have heard about the view container or even worked with some of its API but what about other UI abstractions like element and template references? In this workshop, we’ll implement a couple of advanced DOM manipulation scenarios requiring an extensive knowledge of ViewContainerRef API. I’ll also describe the implications and show examples of working directly with DOM bypassing Angular’s view layer. Along the way, we’ll explore the fundamental building block used internally by the framework to represent UI, which is View, and see what role it plays when working with a component’s view. By the end of the workshop, you’ll have a coherent mental model for view layer in Angular which will enable you to efficiently and correctly implement complex DOM manipulation scenarios.

    Client web applications are rich in events. Button clicks, keystrokes, and mouse moves are events. The data returned from an HTTP request arrives as an event. App components can send and receive messages through an event bus. Every page navigation is an event. Animations emit start and stop events. Events are everywhere. RxJS Observables are the preferred way to manage events in Angular applications and many Angular APIs return RxJS Observables. In this session, I’m going into the why you need to unsubscribe on some observable, and not on others. I’m going into detail and will explain it’s magic. This session covers the basics of RxJS observables for Angular developers. You’ll learn how to work with Angular observable APIs, which RxJS operators you should know, and how to write your own observable APIs.
