      Significance and importance of algorithms can not be overestimated. Even harder to learn how to apply it in the modern Front End, given how many optimizations are done for us by the engines and frameworks. The purpose of this report is to help you understand how this works at a lower level, for example V8, React and not only. Also, what we can do to make more use of the algorithm work, and spend less time and resources.

In my tech corner I’ll cover the topics: How to estimate the uncertainty? How to include risks? What to use: hours or story points? I’ll tell you about the different ways of estimation. Let’s discuss the good and bad cases from our experience and try to find the silver bullet. If it exists.

      Redux is awesome and is used in countless projects. However, using Redux does mean that there is a lot of boilerplate. Enter Redux Cornell. Named after the legendary singer Chris Cornell, Redux Cornell aims to remove most of the boilerplate which comes with using Redux, yet allows you to completely customize it. The library brings the concept of 'convention over configuration' into the JS world to help reduce boiler plate. Redux Cornell now powers Wix's 2nd most visited page with over 3M unique views per month so you can say that it's 'Battle Tested'!

      Maintainable component structure is a crucial prerequisite for a stable React application. You can achieve this by writing your code in a functional way using the higher-order components (HoCs). I want to show you how to define smart HoCs and use them to enhance your presentational components. You'll also learn how to compose several HoCs to get more complex logic. Sticking to this pattern, you'll end up with reusable components that are readable and easy to test since each component is responsible only for a single task.

      Teams today are facing similar problems: How do we encourage the reuse of existing components? How do we raise awareness for them? How do we keep them stable while keeping maintenance efforts low? How do we ensure a coherent branding without exploiting our designers? If you are worried by these questions fear no longer. I aim to show you a way out of this self-made jungle into a brighter world of coded style guides. We will explore together how we can tear down walls between design and development and how everyone can benefit from introducing living component directories into their project.

However, we quickly hit limitations of monolith SPA in the growing company with multiple product teams, different technologies and release cycles. In this talk we share how these limitations have been overcome by extending microservice architecture to React frontend using Lerna mono-repository and discuss alternative approaches such as WebComponents.

      Since the dawn of (internet) time, web developers have been at the mercy of browsers when it comes to features. But what if the black magic they use to create new HTML and CSS properties were given to you? Thats exactly what the Houdini working group is working to provide web developers today! In a futuristic, code heavy session I will show how in the not too distant future, you will be able to create your own custom browser features using low lever APIs never before available to developers.

      Static typing remains a popular topic for discussions somewhat akin to a battle field. JS development world split up into its proponents and opponents. Don't forget that type-code writing is managed by principles and approached different from those required by vanilla JS. It's a different philosophy, so to say. Type JS is very different from non-type one. This becomes a common problem in static type learning and its efficient application. Let's clarify which like JS type code should be. And let's do it step-by-step, getting inspired by strick type programming languages. Let's find out how to apply it so that it proved useful but did not turn into our greatest disappointment. (Flow type will be taken as a basis here, but the majority of these examples will be actual for TypeScript as well).

      There is a wrong way and a right way to deploy, scale and architect an SPA. If you do it the wrong way you DON'T get the advantages of an SPA, you might as well have built a server-side Express app. If you do it the right way, you can take advantage of optimisations that give you epic scalability, with super low latencies at a fraction of the cost. In this talk, I'll teach you the right way to host your SPA (hint: don't use node). I'll unlock the doors to the hidden free caching layer on the internet. I'll prove why serverless & SPAs complement each other so perfectly and I'll show you how easy it is to build the rest of your application using a serverless stack.

      There is always a room for discussion about what to use: tabs or spaces, quotes or double quotes, and so on. There are so many personal preferences in writing code that most likely you'll end up discussing not the logic or implementation itself, but how to use braces, spaces, and semicolons. But do we really need to talk about such things every time we start the project, do code reviews or a new developer joins the team? How to make your code base consistent and clear no matter how big your team or the project are? The whole bunch of tools is here to rescue you! I'm going to talk about all those tools and how to implement them into your code base to help you to improve the development process and code quality.

      I became interested in parsers when I started to use CSS in JS libraries. I am in love with performance and if something works slow - I always try to find the ways to improve it. One of the CSS in JS problem - parsing CSS strings in runtime. Especially if solution should support syntax validation, interpolation for dynamic CSS rules and be super fast and small. Of course we can use postCSS or similar lib to parse CSS to AST, validate it, process it and build final CSS but this approach is not the best for runtime environment (browser). Last year I spent a lot of time for research an development the way to build parser for such cases (and not only for CSS). At OdessaJS I would like to speak about: Basic Parser theory How to build parser using Finite-state machine How to develop parser with super readable code (even juniors could easily contribute it and add new syntax rules without additional knowledges) My fist successful experience using Prepack by Facebook - pre-evaluate parser and compress it to 800 bytes.

      As WebAssmebly is increasing its popularity and more, and more languages start to support WebAssmebly as the build target, development team start asking question when do we need to use WebAssmebly and where it is better to rely on javascript.As open source contributor to WebKit JavaScript Engine, I would like overview differences between WebAssmebly and JavaScript, that engineers should to known when choose between WebAssembly and JavaScript, and overview in which cases is WebAssembly is faster and vice verse

      Most of the work developer does is refactoring and restructuring existing code. While working with React at Product Hunt, I noticed common patterns our team use to deal with changing project requirements. If you have problems dealing with external dependences, reusability and rapidly project iterations - this is the talk for you. Often we start with one top-level redux-connected component and then splitting into several smaller HOCs. One other pattern we use at Product Hunt is to wrap external component to reduce their surface area in the application. This also helps with dealing with dependencies updates

      React and Angular stacks became so similar In 2017-18 as they've never been before. Conceptual distinctions between them are blurring out. There only remained difference in their implementation. Let's talk about the modern work with data and events, role of flows (particularly Rx), functional programming and many more from two points of view: practical and philosophical. We'll also dwell on the work with a code. Thus no-one will have any doubts about the fact that all of us are doing quite the same while a particular stack matters less and less.

      When you are interacting with another piece of software, be it a REST API or a third party, what you’re actually making is your own abstraction around it. Once you realise that, you can use the tricks used in real API clients for your advantage and make reusable, good code.
