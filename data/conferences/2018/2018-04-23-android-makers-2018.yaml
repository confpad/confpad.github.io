      Android Architecture Components is a set of libraries for designing great apps. It contains APIs for implementing concepts like Lifecycle and ViewModel.Whilst these APIs are great, they do come with some questions:• How do Lifecycle, LiveData and ViewModels work under the hood? How and where should each of them be used?• What is the difference between a ViewModel from Architecture Components and the one from the MVVM pattern?• Lifecycle components exist for Activities, Fragments and Application. Why don’t we have the same for Views?• Can we have ViewModels for Views also?s LiveData a replacement for RxJava? Can they live side by side?How does LiveData work with DataBinding?

      There are four primary vital signs: body temperature, blood pressure, pulse (heart rate), and breathing rate (respiratory rate).Can we identify basic signals that would show us the health of an Android app? How about checking for common problems, such as battery drain, jank, crash rate and excessive network usage?Of course, no amount of local testing under laboratory conditions can identify these problems reliably, not with a limited number of devices and users. That's why it's better to check vitals on a living organism, or in this case, an app that is released to users. Open Android Vitals on the Google Play Console to find out about real issues that real users are encountering in the wild.Requiring no special instrumentation from your side, you will get detailed alerts about stuck wakelocks, wrong wakeup and network usage patterns and many more known bad behaviors.But diagnosing the problems is just half of the solution. During this session I will show tools and techniques on how to deal with the issues using tools that we have at our disposal, such as Android Profilers, Systrace, Strict mode, Battery Historian and more.

      Nowadays, Android app design needs are more and more complex: shadows, animations, illustrations, dynamic content. Building layouts that incorporate all those features can be time consuming and, made the wrong way, they will have a significant negative impact on the overall app performance.In this talk we are going to go through building a layout from scratch in Android Studio, demonstrating how developers can take advantage of the latest features to make the whole process as efficient as possible.Along the way we will highlight some of the best practices and show how to avoid common pitfalls in order to create complex yet lightweight layouts.

     The design and usability of an app can be heavily influenced by one of the most common UI elements: TextViews. From font selection and pairing, type size, scale and alignment to line breaking… there’s a lot to consider when displaying text. There are many best practices from print and the web that we can learn from. This talk covers the design principles behind producing balanced, legible text layouts and how to implement them on Android.

      This session doesn’t cover anything of the above, but will show my approach when migrating the Topeka sample to an instant app with multiple, independent feature modules and what I learned. Topeka is a non-trivial sample application with custom sign in, animations, transitions and several Activities and Fragments.I’ll talk about the steps I took and explain the rationale behind them. This will enable you to experiment with Android Instant Apps until you feel your instant app is ready for deployment to production. If you're experimenting with instant apps, you'll have enough to get started and to make a demo for your team. If you're committed to making an instant app, you'll learn how to reduce friction during the refactoring while still maintaining a cod

      Android Studio is a build system-centric IDE, where Gradle is the source of truth. This decision was made when we started Android Studio back in 2013, with the following benefits in mind:1. IDE configuration files (IML files) are generated when syncing a project with Gradle. Developers no longer have to manually edit IML files.2. By delegating builds to Gradle, build output will be the same regardless of where the build is executed: IDE, command line or CI server.

How Android Studio is using it under the hood? Why my ADB server is killed sometimes? And by the way, what this server is about? This talk is made for you.I spent several weeks diving into the ADB source code and I learned interesting things about this project, its history, the internals, the interaction with the developers tools, ... It's time for me to share this with you.Here is an outline of the presentation:How ADB works (the big picture)Some ADB commands you maybe never heard aboutThe history of the projectThe ADB Internals (the ADB protocols, the structure of the software)How development tools are using ADB?

      Behold the promise land of AI. Machine learning has brought natural language processing right into our backyards and with it, the possibilities of different ways of interaction, such as conversations. But the challenges have evolved, as recognizing the input can be done via an API (like DialogFlow), we also need to consider the interface and how to give an experience so natural that it seem like a human conversation. “Oh hi, how are you holding up? because I'm a potato” it's not longer enough, we need conversationally-enabled Android apps built with a different set of design concepts. In this talk we'll review examples of conversational interfaces, benefits of having one on your app, and the core principles for the design process of conversational experiences.

      Kotlin is not just about null safety or data classes. Kotlin has much more to offer. One of the nice things is the ability to use Kotlin's features to create domain specific languages (DSLs).In this talk you will see samples of DSLs you can use in your Android projects and learn how they work.Kotlin DSLs are actually made of many simple Kotlin features - some of which you surely already use, some of which are a bit more obscure. But combined together they give us a powerful way to create nice DSLs.

      Are you living the dream? An architecture so SOLID you could literally build your house on? Tests so fast you can't even sip your coffee before they finish? Code so clean it literally hurts your eyes?No? Then why don't you convince management to start over? Things will be different, you'll do things right.Truth be told, app rewrites seldom work out: estimates turn out to be overly optimistic, functionality a lot more complex and crucial details have been deeply buried in the legacy code. Result: pressure to ship increases and technical debt again piles up.Join this keynote to get a better understanding of the unique challenge of today's ever-growing, more and more complex apps. Learn how we can efficiently tackle legacy code bases and how to get back your developer happiness.

Even the simplest Android application requires the developer to track asynchronous callbacks of the activity, often leading to the infamous callback hell. In this talk, we will have a look at the latest addition to the solutions for dealing with asynchronous programming on Android; Kotlin Coroutines. We'll learn about what coroutines are, how they differ from other models and how to use it with Kotlin on Android.

Themes and styles have always been at the heart of Android development when it comes to UI design. They have been around since API 1 after all and a lot of the Android features are built around them. But do you even know how themes and styles works? What is an attribute? And can you explain the difference between a style, a theme, a text appearance or a theme overlay?Haven’t you ever wanted to globally change the appearance of your `EditText`s or the font face of all `TextView`s in your Android application?

      One of the most interesting new technologies to reach the mainstream eye in 2017 is undoubtedly Flutter, a novel cross-platform framework from Google that targets Android, iOS and the oh-so-elusive Fuchsia OS.Whether you’ve heard of Flutter or not, you will be fascinated by the intriguing design that lurks under the Surface. We’ll dive in to how exactly your Flutter widgets get drawn on screen, from your code all the way down to Skia. Did you know that the UI toolkit in Flutter is based on physical models, and that Material is just one of those? Or that in Flutter the Material and Cupertino (iOS) toolkits share a common heritage in their roots?

Il réduit, optimise et obscurcit le code, ce qui rend l'APK généré plus léger et plus difficile à la rétro-ingénierie ; Mais il peut également casser votre build si les règles ne sont pas appliquées correctement.Google travaille actuellement sur un remplaçant expérimental du ProGuard - R8, qui fonctionnera de manière transparente avec les règles ProGuard existantes.Activer ProGuard peut être une expérience obscure au début. Cette présentation vise à démystifier ProGuard et montrer les avantages de prendre soin de votre bytecode avec tels outils.

      A core part of any app is the ability to know at any given time the set of conditions that make up its current operations. As developers, we need to know this for a variety of reasons, including because knowing this tells us whether we should be queuing any changes and gives us the ability to return the user to their current experience should the application display be interrupted. But despite it’s crucial nature, codifying the state of an application at any given point in time can often be messy and error prone work. In this talk, we’ll look at the reasons representing state can be problematic, and some practical ways to make it better.

      Want to build your own DIY smart house stuff but cannot handle a soldering iron without turning everything into a smoldering pile of ash?I've got you covered! All you need is a Raspberry Pi, a bunch of off-the-shelf sensors and some Kotlin code (and a bit of Javascript). I'll show you how I made my smart house system using Android Things, Firebase, an Android App and Actions for Google without setting anything on fire unintentionally.

      Many apps do unexpected things when a user rotates the device. A message that has been painfully composed using the on-screen keyboard is just gone. Dialogs are disappearing. Data that took a while to load and display is gone and now the app is making the user wait again.All of this is very frustrating to users. But if you know that an Activity is destroyed and then recreated on orientation change, this is not too surprising to you. Still, many beginners don’t know what is going on behind the scenes and consequently come up with flawed or incomplete ways to deal with the lifetime of an Activity.If you have ever “fixed” a bug by changing your app’s manifest to manually handle orientation changes or by locking the device orientation, this talk is for you. It aims to give attendees a better understanding of the Activity lifetime/lifecycle. And we will look at the fundamental ways to deal with this situation. So you can write better apps.

      One We know one of the main characteristics of Java is portability, and that usually means it is not as efficient as it should be. That might be the reason Java has never been associated with high performance, but nowadays there are a lot of Java powered devices in the world and lots of people are building applications for them.Compilers that produce native machine code do a great optimization job because they know where the code is going to be executed. But because of the portability feature, the Java Compiler could not assume anything about where our program is going to run and leaves all the optimizations to be done by the JVM while loading or, even, running our code. This has been the case until Google introduced Jack and Jill compilers, but now that has already deprecated them in favour of Java 8 tooling and introducing the new D8 compiler, will this assumption still be true? Also, with the recent addition of Kotlin, there is another language that generates bytecode. How will it perform compared with plain Java code?In this session, you will not only learn what to avoid when looking for critical performance, you’ll also get a bigger understanding of how the java compiler works

Custom tasks, advanced usages, … the use cases are infinite.Gradle offers the possibility to integrate custom plugins directly in your project, without the need to make a separate project and publish the artifact in a maven repository. This presentation will walk you through this concept, with a couple of concrete example of plugins you can write yourself.

      As Android developers, we’re constantly trying to improve our teams by convincing others to move in a new direction. Whether it’s convincing other engineers to adopt Kotlin or convince your design team to create Android mocks, almost any improvement you want to make requires convincing others to make a change.In this talk, we’ll discuss how to effectively create the change you want by focusing on the incentives of others. We’ll start by discussing how to understand what other parties want so that you can make it clear how your initiative helps all stakeholders. Next, we’ll talk about how to identify areas of risk that may prevent your idea from moving forward, as well as how to mitigate that risk. Finally, we’ll discuss the critical role of trust in creating change, and how to use every interaction as a chance to build the trust you need to help you succeed.

      We interact with buttons every day to get coffee, order pizza, or start a new Gradle build. They may look simple and straightforward, but they have a fundamental role in our environment: create a sense of power.We all love to feel empowered and we all hate being frustrated by bad design. Your users know this as well, they want to feel immediately rewarded when they interact with your UI, and they will quickly drop your app if they get annoyed.At Yelp, we get tens of millions button clicks a day. At that kind of scale, every pixel matters. We tune every single aspect of our buttons to make them simple and powerful, but adjusting every single shadow cast, click animation, or color layer can be tricky. In this talk, we will provide a deep dive into the Android framework and the Support Library to understand how buttons are rendered.

From working in distributed teams to fending off fraudulent clones of your application, you eventually come to understand the importance of signatures.In this talk we'll take a deep dive into the Android keystore system, certificates and signatures, and go over key points necessary for any application's long and productive life. Also, we will cover some security tips and tricks that will help ensure your app is safe to use, even if the users are faced with its evil twin.At the end you should walk away with a deeper insight into everyday mechanisms that are often taken for granted, and the impact that they have on your users' security.

      While building entire cross-platform apps might often turn out to be a bad idea, mission-critical client-specific logic can greatly benefit from an unique codebase, allowing code to be written - and tested - once. Since end 2016, Kotlin/Native can compile Kotlin code to a binary form, which can be embedded into a native app. In this talk you will learn why it makes sense, and how, to leverage these experimental features and build a cross-platform module reusable on both Android and iOS.

      Imagine the following. You're happily coding along when you suddenly realize that there is a serious security flaw with your app. At first you may be in disbelief. You might turn to your co-worker and ask, “Does this sound right to you?“ Then the realization of the magnitude of the problem slowly dawns on you. You might swear, walk outside for fresh air, or even laugh out loud, not knowing how else to respond.Maybe you haven't experienced anything like that. In Clive's talk, you will explore some commonly overlooked areas of Android programming that may pose serious security concerns, so that this doesn't happen to you in the future.Why overlooked? Because most of the issues Clive brings up may seem like it has nothing to do with security, even to an experienced Android developer. Addressing these issues may seem like busy work that someone on the team should do, but no one ends up doing because no time is allotted for it. These issues include, for example, logging, obfuscation, NDK, library dependencies, and more! Clive's hope for this talk is that we recognize the security implications of these overlooked areas and thus prioritize addressing these issues

      The Google Assistant - your own Google, always ready to help - and its developer platform have been out for more than a year.Besides controlling your music, lights and asking about the weather, Assistant apps have been struggling to get into the users' daily routine. It is time for you to be on the forefront of the revolution by adding some conversational features in your mobile app.In this talk, we're going to explain how you can implement a custom conversational feature in your existing Android or iOS app. Today, mobile apps are the medium people use to get their information and get things done, and is the perfect way of getting them used to this new world of conversational apps.Google is really pushing this new platform forward by adding a plethora of new features to the Google Assistant such as support for more languages, family-friendly apps, an improved app directory and making it available on a lot of devices, from your phone to cars and smart speakers.

      Everyone knows you need to do code reviews, but with more than 2-3 developers, and in a sprint with 10+ tasks in the backlog, this is becoming an issue. This presentation will be about how we have managed to overcome this challenge and how we have made code reviews fast, efficient, and a part of our daily routine (without adding them to the list of tasks). We will emphasize on the Git approach and the methodologies around this and similar tools. We will share all our trials, fails and wins and discuss how we can make this work for you too.

      Creating a personal Android app requires us to solve a lot of common challenges. Sometimes some of these challenges require so much time that we start to forget about the product we are building. Firebase can act as a toolbox to give functionality like analytics, databases, messaging and crash reporting so we can move quickly and focus on our users.

      Sound on Android is a topic that is rarely covered, which is why I wanted to shed some lights in my experience with the sound management APIs on Android.So in this talk, we'll touch on how sounds actually work programmatically, and we'll talk about how to play a sound on Android in the most simple way. We will also cover the principle of sound focus, what it is, how and when to use it. We'll see what we can do with MIDI as well. And finally, we'll go deeper in the rabbit hole and get introduced to the lower levels of sounds processing with the help of OpenSL ES and the SuperPowered library.

      Android Auto, une plateforme en forte croissance grâce aux constructeurs automobiles qui l’intègrent dans leurs voitures et soutenu par énormément d’entreprise de l’Open Automotive Alliance. Aujourd'hui, on peut être de plus en plus en contact avec nos médias favoris, y compris dans notre voiture, même en roulant à 250km/h sur le périph.Chez Canal+, nous avons sauté le pas et mis en production une application Android Auto. Le but de cette présentation sera de vous introduire au joyeux monde du développement d’application pour les voitures connectées.Au programme, une introduction à Android Auto, comment tester l'application (sans voiture, ma boite n'a pas voulu installer de Renault Espace dans l'open space). Mais aussi, comment intégrer Exoplayer, les MediaSession, ainsi qu'une explication des contraintes très présentes, notamment au niveau de la sécurité bien évidemment, mais rien d'insurmontable vous pouvez me faire confiance.

      Kotlin is out here for a while now but many developers don’t use full power of it and write Java-style of Kotlin. let and apply are the only language features get adopted. This talk is aimed to overcome a small learning curve in one very common thing developers work every day with: collections. Backed by familiar Java collection API but supplemented by a set of handy functions, Kotlin collection API becomes a versatile tool that helps to develop faster and makes code clearer and nicer.In this talk we’ll look into most common functions and how to mix and apply them into practice.

      Android Oreo introduced exciting text changes that make it easier to use custom fonts, communicate with emojis, reduce APK size, and expand or contract textviews dynamically. Luckily, the Support Libraries from v26 onwards allow us to implement these new features with backwards compatibility.In this talk, you will learn how to implement these text changes with the help of the Support Libraries, and their limitations. You will also learn about how they are natively implemented in Android Oreo versus the Support Libraries.At the end of this talk, you will have an increased understanding of the inner workings of Fonts in XML, Downloadable Fonts, EmojiCompat and autosizing of TextViews, as well as be ready to update your apps with them without the fear of the unknown!

      How do you create a mobile-only bank account that customers trust enough to deposit money in? The mobile application needs to be high quality. After evaluating and comparing what other companies, small and big, do to test their android applications and the available technologies (device farms, hypervisors...), we picked Genymotion on Demand and built a continuous integration system in the AWS cloud. The cost and coverage of running tens of thousands of Espresso tests every day are tracked. We have fragmentation of OS versions and screen sizes. Tests are sharded to reduce build time. Videos of tests are recorded. JUnit test reports are generated. We had to adapt to open source libraries breaking because of new versions of the Android toolchain. This is a multi-technology stack using Android, Bash, Gradle, Cloud Formation, Teamcity, Slack, C++, Python, Groovy, Artifactory... This is about sharing the journey and what we learned along the way, from building internal buy-in to providing feedback to Genymotion itself and the many technical things that broke along the way. We are using this system and plan to expand it with Appium tests for application upgrade and stress testing.

      Kotlin offers a modern language design in contrast to Java, while at the same time maintaining full Java interoperably: Data classes, properties, delegation, inline functions, string interpolation and much more. But, if Java can't offer these features how come Kotlin can? What does Kotlin do to make it possible to use this Syntactic sugar?In this talk, we will go backstage and dig into the Bytecode that Kotlin generates to make all the features we love work on a runtime that technically does not support them. We will look at the impact kotlin code generations has on method count. Get a deeper understanding of how Object and companion object work and see the implications of the use of either under different circumstances. Finally look at common patterns that can help reduce the size of both the bytecode and method count.

      You open a pull request only to find that some tests are now failing. What goes through your mind?Did I break something? Do I need to update the tests? Just what is that test testing anyway?Ideally, 2 would almost never be the case, as rewriting a test usually means it's lost the regression testing value of its original form. How can we get there though? There’s no one right way to write tests, and it’s surprisingly easy to fall into the trap of writing change tests. There are good patterns you can leverage to scale them and maximize their long term value. This talk will detail simple patterns you can follow for healthy, pragmatic testing with a focus on test design, correctness, and how these values can translate into better overall API design of your code.

      We are now operating in a data-driven world. If your company isn't using metrics to determine what their next step is, then your company is likely moving blindly. That is fairly universally accepted, but what's worse is when what your metrics tell you isn't true. It is very easy for a metric logging error to complete invalidate your conclusion. This talk discusses what we at Pinterest do to avoid this.

      Les test d'UI sont une étape importante dans le processus de création d'une application robuste et stable sur le long terme. Pourtant, une grande majorité des développeurs android sautent cette étape soit par manque de temps soit parce que les tests d'UI sont compliqués et laborieux à écrire. Depuis que nous sommes organisés en feature team au Boncoin et que nos livraisons se font toutes les 3 semaines, nous avons besoin de faciliter et d'automatiser au maximum l'écriture et l'exécution des tests d'UI. C'est pour cela que nous avons mis en place une solution composée de Barista, une surcouche d'espresso, de Swarmer, permettant de gérer et d’exécuter une batterie d’émulateurs et enfin Composer pour orchestrer le tout et générer les rapports de tests. C'est cette solution que nous allons vous présenter outils par outils puis au sein de notre CI avec une démo en situation réelle.

      Kotlin has become the default modern programming language for many Android developers, with first-class support in Android Studio. But exactly how much performance and code size are we sacrificing for making use of all the additional features this language provides compared to Java?We'll study the Java bytecode generated by the Kotlin compiler in various scenarios in order to find out which code constructs come with hidden performance penalties and learn how to become better Kotlin programmers. Some significant improvements in the recent versions of Kotlin will also be highlighted.This talk is based on the series of blog posts from the speaker and extends it in some areas.
