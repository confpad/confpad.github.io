      John Leider is the creator of Vutify, the component framework that utilizes Google’s Material Design Spec. In this talk John covers the new features and functionality that’s up and coming in Vuetify 2.0. Specifically, he’s looking to improve customization by making it easier to configure, using Material Design 2 custom themes, and allowing for the modification of your Vuetify settings from the Vue CLI UI. Vuetify 2 will improve performance through automatic tree shaking (or what they call “a-la-carte”), smaller bundle sizes, and optimizations across all device sizes. It will also be more accessible, with full RTL support, section 508 compliance, and following web content accessibility guidelines. The last is support, which they’ll do by releasing weekly patches, daily canary builds, long term support, and engaging community.

      It might not be obvious how to use Vue's reactive data with non-HTML web technologies, but it's easier than you might think. See how it's done, learn the tradeoffs of each technology, and gain tips to optimize performance. You'll be building stunning visualizations to impress clients and colleagues in less time than you think!

      We keep shipping more and more features in our Web applications, and as a result, we ship heavier apps that take more time to load. So we use bundlers like webpack to split our application code into multiple bundles and load them asynchronously. As a result, we end up having asynchronous code pretty much everywhere in our apps. This means that we need to handle unexpected errors that were otherwise impossible, like network ones, handle loading state and make sure the application is able to recover from these errors. During this talk, we will take a look at different patterns about handling asynchronous request correctly in Vue applications in order to make our Apps feel light, fast and reliable everywhere.

      We often need to deal with token-based authentication when building Single Page Applications. There is a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt when it comes to JWTs, so how can you be sure you are handling token-based auth properly? In this talk, I will cover best practices when it comes to implementing token-based authentication using JWTs in a Vue.js SPA.

      Charles is the co-founder of Snipcart, a custom e-commerce service for developers which recently went through a rewrite. In the talk Charles demonstrates a wonderful use-case for creating a custom rendering function for Vue, which allows developers using the Snipcart service to easily insert inject template code where needed. They also created Microcomponents to encapsulate UI logic and integrated Vue and Redux together.

      At BlastMotion, the company Houmaan works for, they wanted to migrate to Vue, so they started using it in small pieces of their front-end. Unfortunately, that meant there were places where Vue.js had to talk to the outside world (their JQuery code). In this talk, Houmaan shows how to communicate events between Vue.js code and outside JavaScript.
