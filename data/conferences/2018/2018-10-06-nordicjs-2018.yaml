      Node.js is an amazing project in terms of code - it’s evolved rapidly to cover an immense landscape, from web apps, desktop apps, APIs, IoT, robotics, and beyond. There’s something else that Node has also been absolutely killer with, though: the community.  One really awesome thing is that the Node.js community has an established community for building the Node community. How meta is that? The Node.js project is sectioned off into different Working Groups (WGs) that are tasked with different objectives - the one that was tasked with building the community was the Evangelism WG.  That said, there’s a transition happening. The Evangelism WG planted the seed Node.js Community efforts. Now, the Community Committee has taken this a step further and is mobilizing to start exploding the awareness and understanding of Node and its diverse ecosystem.

      Perceived performance is not only about fast page loads and delivering the content as early as possible. It is also about all the interactions happening on an already loaded page. Even some of the most popular UI patterns can be a cause of frustration. Understanding what is happening under the browser’s hood can help you delight users with a smooth experience and avoid potential performance issues. Let’s demystify the rendering process and look into possible optimisations in order to achieve the best experience after the initial page load.

      With the rise of web-to-native cross-platform solutions like React Native and Electron we got to witness not only their potential but also their shortcomings. Thanks to WebAssembly we now have an alternative that uses a different approach but promises the same results. In my talk, I’ll share the lessons the join.me team learned over the last few years while creating and maintaining a cross-platform (web included!) C++ codebase, with special attention to management and team-dynamic aspects. You’ll also see how WebAssembly changes the game and, through a bit of live-coding, how easy it is to get started with it.

      Do you know what is the definition of "healthy" for your Node app? Is only measured by CPU consumption or memory usage? Number of requests per second? What is *tick frequency* or *event loop latency* and what does it means if these metrics are going haywire? We will talk about different metrics you can look at to define whether your application is ok or not and we will try to debunk some mysteries of the event loop and threads along the way.

      Fear of criticism can be a proxy for fear of failure and fear of exposure. It can stifle learning and growth and promote secretive behaviors. Opening ourselves and our communities up to criticism can help us to experience less fear and accomplish what we want to achieve.  Feedback can be hard—both on the giving and the receiving ends. As programmers, we criticize (and compliment!) our peers’ work—-their art, their craft—-daily, at both a low and high levels of detail. How we work with this feedback—-accept it, apply it, use it, discount it, reject it, love it, feel it, bear it…—-and how we give it shapes the culture around us. We’ll explore strategies for using corrections and criticisms productively by drawing parallels to how feedback works (and doesn’t) in other settings, especially in the context of a ballet class, where secretive behaviors aren't an option.

      A typical interaction with a device or interface involves touching it. Either you're pressing buttons on a controller, swiping on a touchscreen or clicking on your laptop's trackpad. But what if you could control things without the use of your hands? What if you could use... your thoughts? I have been tinkering with a brain sensor and developed an open source JavaScript framework for it to allow me (or anyone else) to control interfaces or robots using facial expressions and mental commands.

      Many developers are familiar with the powerful Chrome DevTools that help us inspect, profile, and debug our web applications. But, did you know that Chrome exposes virtually all the same information and capabilities via an API that you can use in JavaScript?  In this talk, we’ll look at how you can start using the Chrome DevTools Protocol today to unlock powerful automation techniques for your web application. We’ll cover how to start using the protocol through Puppeteer and then dive into some of the really exciting possibilities that have opened up when using this in conjunction with headless browsers, such as holistic application benchmarking, the collection of code usage metrics, and new testing paradigms.

      Graphics programming is more accessible than ever, thanks to the ubiquity of WebGL and popular frameworks that handle the boilerplate stuff. But for many of us, as soon as we see “projection matrix” (or worse, “linear algebra”) we panic. But it turns out the matrix is nothing to fear! With the help of some fun visualization tools we’ll learn all about what matrix transformations actually mean on your screen. You’ll leave empowered with a better understanding of how to translate any kind of 3D scene onto a 2D screen in JavaScript, so that you can start writing new WebGL visualizations faster than you can say mat4.scale(...).translate(...).rotateX(...) .rotateZ(...).translate(...).scale(...).invert()...

      In Norway, all websites are required by law to be accessible. Thanks to the Norwegian regulations, accessibility cannot be treated as "nice to have" - it's a "must have." But since we were white-label service, we were faced with two must-haves: Our customers should be able to pick any color as their brand color, but on the other hand, colors should have sufficient contrast according to the WCAG criteria. The solution came combining CSS Custom Properties with a sprinkle of JavaScript, which meant we could automatically create a color palette.

      Last year we started working on a new web framework for Node.js, Fastify. Fastify is a highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture. Why you built another web framework? This is one of the questions we get more often. Most of the currently available web frameworks are well established, work with a defined pattern and have a very big usage among Node.js users. Try to innovate how they work is too risky, you will destroy the compatibility with the past. This is how the open source world works, “or you die as innovator, or you live long enough to become the technical debt”. With Fastify we wanted to push forwards the limit of the platform and engage a sane spirit of competition with other framework creators. We focused on build from zero an architecture pattern, a plugin system and other components of the framework. We focused also on build a future proof system, that will help the users build what they need in the easiest way possible.

      Functional reactive programming is based on the idea that applications can be built around streams. The structure TypeScript imposes provides us with a declarative syntax that gives semantic meaning to the streams of events and commands our application uses to build state in redux architecture. There is some boilerplate required to pull this off, but it is worth it for large scale applications, examples in Ngrx with Angular.

      Within the process of building a brand new application, us engineers are used to consider a lot of issues users may have while using our website or app: cross browser compatibility, accessibility and responsiveness are a few of the things that are always on our mind, but are we really building apps for everyone? Brazil has a population of over 207 million people and only 37,9% of them have access to LTE phones; most of them still use 3G and even 2G networks.  Cellular data is still really expensive, as well as most modern smartphones, which makes most digital experiences unfeasible. However, there's a light in the end of the tunnel! By optimizing the performance on our digital products, we can reach these kinds of users and end up crafting a better experience for all of them. In this talk I'll go through my past experiences implementing performance optimized applications, some of the best practices you can use on your own projects and some of the challenges citizens from emerging countries still face.  In this talk, I'll go through the concepts and practical implementations of performance enhancements like code splitting, css inlining, gzip, resource minification, usage of asynchronous scripts and other concerns that can really change the user experience on a website. Since I'll go from basic concepts to the actual implementation, it'll be applicable and tangible to audiences of different levels of expertise.

      HTTP has been gradually adding lots of new and exotic headers, and more are on the way. Learn about current best practices with Vary, Link, Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy, Client-Hints, Clear-Site-Data and Alt-Svc, upcoming features such as Feature-Policy and proposals like Variants, Early-Hints and Origin-Policy. HTTP gives you incredibly powerful control over many aspects of the way a browser will process the page, and is often a more effective or more secure option than trying to achieve the same effect with tags or script in the page.

      Have you ever wondered how new language features get into JavaScript? This talk will take TypedArrays, a seemingly simple JavaScript feature, and go down the rabbit hole of implementation and optimization in V8. You’ll get a behind-the-scenes look at how a feature goes from idea, to specification, to implementation and beyond.  JavaScript is a constantly evolving language, and for browser vendors this means work. New features are regularly added or tweaked in the language specification, and it is down to the browser vendors to get these features to users as quickly as possible. Can you balance speed, correctness, and security in order to ship new features? This talk explains the trade-offs that are made and tells the story of the mistakes made and lessons learned writing a JavaScript compiler at Google.
