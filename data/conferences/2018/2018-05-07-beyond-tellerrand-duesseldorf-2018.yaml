      Web Annotation—now a W3C standard—aims to establish a conversation layer on top of the web. By theoretically allowing anyone to annotate any web page content, it’s an ennobling premise and thoroughly web-like: democratic, open and standardised. But with this freedom comes challenges. Content publishers are faced with an anxiety-inducing lack of control over what people say about their content. And nothing in the standard itself protects against conversations devolving into troll-hijacked chaos. The evolution of Web Annotation mirrors that of the Web itself, in miniature, facing off with some of the same big themes of identity, security, authority and freedom.

      Kate has designed and directed content projected onto a floor of ice, the ceiling of the London Design Museum, the bridge of the USS intrepid in NY and put content onto the smallest LEDs to create one of the largest screens for the London 2012 Olympics ceremonies. 2017 in particular saw two diverse, exciting and extremely complex projects! It goes without saying that each project requires a unique approach. But that approach encompasses so many variants. These large-scale projects are inevitably a roller-coaster ride of design, decision making, blood, sweat and sometimes, just sometimes tears! Kate will be going behind the scenes, To give an insight into the influences, processes and the challenges behind these kind of projects.

      Advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence are moving very fast now. People are starting to wonder what role Robots will have in our society. While many researchers are focusing on the very practical side, we have to wonder how we will interact with the Robots on a social level. How will we feel about them, and even more important: how will they feel about us? Jan will give an overview of his robot projects from recent years, giving insights in their production, and in their effect on their audience.

      Claire Evans, author of Broad Band: The Untold History of the Women who Made the Internet, will share stories about the hardworking women who challenged convention to make key contributions to the history of our century’s most transformative cultural technology—the Internet. As we face issues of privacy, identity, and society in a networked world, we have much to learn from these women, who anticipated the Internet’s greatest problems, faced them, and discovered solutions we can still use today.

      Wes will share his 23+ years of experience starting out as a web programmer freelancing, to an interactive director at an ad agency to founding his own data visualisation studio in 2006. He will talk about how the journey (aka the process) is equally as important as arriving at the destination. And that journey is often faced with bumpy roads and unpleasant, unexpected events that we have to face and manage. In an ideal world, we all want our work and our relationships to succeed, but when they don’t, how can we create an environment that will catch our falls and give us the tools to keep going and build more strength for greater success. And what is success anyway?!

      Vic will talk about his beginnings, how he got started as an illustrator, muralist, wordsmith and man of many Inkings. But to get to where he is has been a journey, from working 7 days a week, to constantly challenging himself and getting noticed in an increasingly flooded market. Vic will talk about hard work, how it pays off. Being reliable, always saying yes, and getting new clients. It's not a quick fix, but a dedicated daily routine to being the best he can be and to think of the next thing before some other sucker does. Vic will show how his clients trust him, from Nike to Virgin, The Tate to some of the worlds best design agencies. It's not about slacking or being scared and its realising that there is no such thing as failure.

      Design can feel super intimidating when you feel more comfortable with code and don’t have a background in design. Knowing design basics and shortcuts can help your career in measurable ways: by helping you work more effectively with your coworkers as well as making it easier and faster for you to launch new projects from scratch without hiring a designer. This presentation will go over design for non-designers, skipping the university-level concepts and jumping right to shortcuts and easy-to-remember principles. Recommended for those who want to learn just enough design to be dangerous (or for designers who’d like to better teach their coworkers and colleagues); featuring quick hits, easy to understand and utilize principles that anyone can use to improve their design skills.

      Web layout has always been a hack — compounded by responsive design, web application needs, and the desire for consistency. Join the creator of Susy (a meta grid-system) for a review of layout and grid techniques — when to use them, what to consider, and how to roll your own layouts with minimum code. We'll look at everything from floats to CSS Grid, flexbox, and even custom properties — and how to start using the new toys right away, with only a few lines of code. When to use floats, CSS Grid, flexbox, custom properties, and other techniques How to make grid-math simple, and lose the grid-system How to make grid-systems work for you when you need them

      Interactive animation in the browser is currently pretty limited when it comes to choice - you can either go the super-slow css / svg / animated gif route, or the powerful but proprietary Unity ecosystem. Rob has spent the last few years working on projects that demanded something more, and takes us through the problems encountered - as well as his own open source solution from work at The Away Foundation.

      When might pair programming be a good choice? Do we plan time in for it? How can we measure its benefits? I think these are all difficult questions to answer in workplaces that need developers to deliver work on time and on budget. I want to talk about how, as a beginner developer, I view pair programming, and what I've learned from other developers who have had experience with it.

      Still think browsers are only capable of parsing HTML, CSS and JavaScript? Think again! Browsers have become much more powerful and contain numerous APIs that can enrich the user experience or are just plain fun. This talk will introduce you to some of them and show you how easy it is to unleash their power with JavaScript.
