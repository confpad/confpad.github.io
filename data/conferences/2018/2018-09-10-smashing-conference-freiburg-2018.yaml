      Systems and products that have the most influence on the world today tend to have the least presence. What tools can we use to make their intangibility and intensely unhuman scale more human and tangible? We’ll look at book design, how designers of the 20th century have tackled this problem, and how meditative practices such as vipasanna and walking are useful tools in the contemporary human toolkit.

      How do you know what consumers expect from your site? Every shopper is different and every shopping visit is different. Industry stats tell only part of the story.

      Whether or not the product you’re creating is currently only being sold in one country, it’s always crucial to design and build it with global audiences in mind.Many businesses are convinced that designing for other markets means copying their successful business model in the home country. They believe that localisation is about translation. They design their products without properly understand what changes are needed and why they are needed. Even big companies do not always get it right.In this talk, Chui Chui will discuss how these inaccurate perceptions can lead to flawed businesses and decisions, and explore why and how to understand and design for users in different markets.

      Every decision we make is one made on behalf of your user. How do we know the decisions we make are the right ones? It is time we initiate a conversation: About where we are and where we want to go, about how we define and measure goodness and rightness in the digital realm, about responsibility, about decisions and consequences, about building something bigger than our own apps. It is time we talk about the ethics of design.This talk introduces a method for ethical decision making in design and tech. Rather than a wet moralistic blanket covering the fires of creativity, ethics can be the hearth that makes our creative fires burn brighter without burning down the house.

      Seb loves to strip down classic machines from the 80s, and give them an extreme make-over with cutting edge technology. You may have seen the hacked Nintendo light gun with laser, lights and a built-in smoke machine that became a viral sensation on the internet in 2016.This insight into technology from a simpler age gives us a new found appreciation and understanding about the tools we use on a daily basis.Expect super bright LEDs, electronics and, of course, lasers.

      The design and presentation of data is just as important as the underlying algorithm, and designers have an urgent role to play in crafting the emerging generation of AI interfaces.Designer Josh Clark explores a rich trove of examples—at once entertaining and sobering—to unearth design principles for creating responsible machine-learning applications.Learn to use AI as design material in your everyday work. Adapt to the machines’ weird, unexpected, or flat-out-wrong conclusions. And above all, scrub data for bias to create the respectful and inclusive world we all want to live in.
