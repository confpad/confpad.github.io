    Keeping developers and designers in sync is an ongoing challenge for our industry, with both disciplines working in completely different mediums. Lately, we have seen the emergence of tools like react-sketchapp and html-sketchapp that allow us to generate Sketch libraries from our application code. In this talk, we will run through a real-world example of this technique, have a closer look at how.it all works, and show you how you can start experimenting with this yourself. Most importantly, we will talk about what this means for the future of design.

    Robert DROP TABLE Students-- The little Bobby Tables is embodying the classical fear of SQL injections when building web applications.However, SQL injections are just one aspect of security we need to worry about when building web applications. With the recent popularity of Angular, React and other Single Page Application frameworks we got more logic executing on the front-end, create new problems, and make you forget about others.

    Web fonts are awesome. They make your sans-serifs slabby, your headers special and your website look gorgeous. But fonts are a resource, and downloading resources always comes as a cost — if you don’t load web fonts efficiently, what you get instead are phantom underlines, blank pages, and user rage. Let’s talk about ways to avoid this, and what new platform features are here to help us deliver pretty (but also!) fast experiences to everyone.

    Aside from the fact that the core of React was completely rewritten, version 16 also comes with some powerful new features. We`ll see interesting and practical use-cases for error boundaries, portals, and fragments. Additionally, we`re gonna explore some experimental features like react-call-return and we`re going to see what does the future hold for React.

    When a highly hyped new tool is released, many users end up disappointed that it doesn’t handle their use case easily or that it isn’t as polished as they expected. Others don’t bother because the documentation isn’t good enough and there aren’t enough learning resources. If the project survives, then over time developers will chip away at these problems, but it’s often hard to convince people to shake their initial impression. React Native is no different from other tools in this regard, so I want to present a few reasons why you might want to give React Native a(nother) try now, nearly three years since its initial release.

    Redux is as a modern popular state management library in frontend today. But if you dig a little deeper, you will find out the Redux build on top of patterns and concepts that was introduced 20 years ago. During this session, we talk about design patterns from the world of micro services and messaging systems and see how to use those ideas in the context of modern single page app. You will never use Redux the same way again.

    This talk will explore the changes that have occurred in the front end space in the past few years and how we’ve aligned on the concepts of components being the key building block for frontend applications.We’ll discuss how thinking of a web application as a tree of components, rather than discrete pages, leads to a more testable, maintainable and reliable codebase. We’ll look at how we can build predictable components, encapsulating perfectly the triumvirate of HTML, CSS and JS that can be combined to build reusable components.Using React as our component library of choice, we’ll look at patterns that lead you down the path of reusability almost by default and how to walk the fine line between reusability and death by configuration.Then we’ll explore the final piece of the puzzle,CSS. CSS goes against everything the componentised world stands for but its global, cascading nature can be tamed. I’ll show different approaches to combining your CSS with your components in order to fully encapsulate a component into a lovely, reusable lego brick.

    You have heard of all types of driven development but react emerged a new type, styleguide driven development became a reality with components. This type of development focuses on Developer/Designer collaboration and on assertive components. With the use of React, CSS-in-JS, Flow and Snapshot testing we were able to almost remove style regressions. In this talk you get a glimpse of you can start styleguide driven development and how you can sell this dream to your project managers.

    Recursion and iteration are two alternative paradigms for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller chunks; this talk is a deep dive into how these paradigms work, and how JS supports them both. There’s a fundamental tradeoff between the two: the stateful repetition of iteration is often more performant as it’s closer to the way our machines “think”, whereas many programmers find the self-referential abstraction of recursion easier to read & write. In JS prior to ES6, neither paradigm was especially easy to work with: iterative loops were laborious to read and write (not human-efficient), and recursion was limited by the fact that subsequent recursive calls to a function require additional frames added to the stack, potentially leading to stack overflow (not machine-efficient). Eventually, however, all three - recursion, iteration, and JS - were finally brought closer together. In this talk we’ll dive into the nature of the two paradigms, examine what an Iterable and a tail-recursive function are, and learn how Tail Call Optimization unites the two paradigms, allowing us to write code recursively and run it iteratively.

    Wooed by the possibility to put LEDs on ALL THE THINGS and control them with an app, I bought my first (and second and third...) arduino this year and haven’t looked back. But, as a IoT newbie, I defaulted to what I knew as a frontend developer. I applied the libraries I was familiar with from my daily work to solve my IoT problems with lackluster results. Things kind of worked, but the connections were flaky and it crashed a lot. It felt like there had to be something out there that was a better fit for communicating from the web to hardware. In my pursuit for a minimalist solution that could handle poor network connections and had implementations in C++ and JavaScript, I found the MQTT protocol.MQTT is a lightweight messaging architecture for sending data between hardware and other devices where a small code footprint and performance in poor network conditions are crucial. In this talk, we’ll look what exactly what MQTT is, how I use it in my own art/wearable project, and why you should check it out for your next hardware project.

    Since 2016 the VR technology has been a rising trend again, and many types of headsets are out in the market. Proprietary tools for creating VR apps have their requirements for ecosystems, controllers, installations etc. And the simplest of applications needs a lot of complex/boilerplate code to be written for setup. A-Frame is an open source web framework which enables creating VR experiences with simple HTML and little JS without much efforts. You learn how to use it to create fantastic VR applications which can even be multi-user/real-time and also get inspired from some usecases.
