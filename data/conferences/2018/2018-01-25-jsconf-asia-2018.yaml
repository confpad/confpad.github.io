    CSS Blend modes are underutilized and can be used for a variety of things from improving image performance to creating scalable styling. This talk goes over some case studies where blend modes can make a big impact, talks about browser support, and also discusses workaround for including blend modes where they aren't supported. Tour the wide world of CSS Blend modes and learn why you may want to introduce them in your own web-based projects today!

    Ever wondered how many times the ads in your website are using document.write? Or if you were writing to the DOM from untrusted sources? Such questions can be answered by dynamically analysing the JavaScript running in your website. Static analysis of JavaScript leads to a lot of false positives and is incredibly hard to do correctly due to features like eval, XHR, etc. Dynamic analysis of JavaScript gives much more accurate results. I will talk about using meta programming APIs such as Proxies, overriding native DOM APIs and inbuilt JS functions, using Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs), etc. to carry out your own dynamic analysis, the gotchas involved and how I handled them. Also, I will be demonstrating how to use the open-source proxy module I wrote, which makes it easy to get started on carrying out these kinds of dynamic analysis on real-world web applications.

We want to share our lessons learned to highlight that, though many of our visualizations had humble, ugly duckling beginnings, we were able to produce unique and compelling results through many (embarrassing) iterations.

    Serverless computing is a powerful way for JavaScript developers to create backend services that can power a variety of experiences from the browser to IoT devices. At Adobe, we are embracing serverless as a way to enable our developer ecosystem to easily create experience applications that extend our solutions. We’re building this platform, Adobe I/O Runtime, on top of an open source project, Apache OpenWhisk. In this talk you’ll learn about Apache OpenWhisk, what kinds of use cases are good for serverless, and how to use build serverless applications using NodeJS. Using Adobe I/O Runtime, you’ll see how to deploy code as serverless functions, how event-driven architecture can be a powerful compliment for serverless, how to build more complex applications by combining multiple functions, and how to expose your functions as APIs so they can be used across multiple experiences. You’ll walk away with a clear picture of where it makes sense to use serverless computing and how to get started.

    In 2015 I published an article on JavaScript's "World Domination". Back then, a bit more than two years ago, in this 6000-word beast JavaScript on hardware was almost like an afterthought, a footnote on the last page and a bit. But even then, the writing was already on the wall — it was only a matter of time until JavaScript's triumphant march reached the most minute of the silicone army… Indeed,two years later, there's already this thriving ecosystem of tiny JavaScript-dialects: they are powering a wide variety of miniature computers (colloquially only referred to as ""IoT""), from industry automations to smartwatches, they are everywhere. My bet is, even if you have never heard of JerryScript, duktape, or V7 before — you surely will want to now. ;)

    At 10am on Black Friday, your phone rings: the new JS application you deployed came under too much load, and the site has gone down! Your employer is losing sales opportunities... your employer is losing money! But you don’t lose your cool. You log into your cloud provider and tweak your autoscaling settings. Now the deployment can handle the load spike but with four times the number of servers, which is four times the cost. The next day, you try to analyze what happened and begin to optimize your application to prepare for future load spikes. This talk is a journey into the world of Node.js performance, taking a look at the available tools and optimization techniques inspired by insight gained from glimpsing under the hood of Node and V8.

    Do you cringe when you have to design and build layouts on the web? Do you get frustrated when things never go where you want them to on your page? Creating custom layouts is not a trivial task, no matter what your sales rep or account manager says. Fortunately, browsers now support a plethora of CSS properties that make building creative layouts much less painful than before. This workshop will cover a range of techniques for building cutting-edge web layouts with fallbacks for older browsers as well. It will be a practical workshop with code examples you can refer to for your future projects.

    The workshop will cover different techniques on adapting websites to the upcoming HTTP/2 protocol. By the end of the workshop, participants would be well equipped with the tools and skills required to update and deploy a production-ready HTTP/2 website. We will be discussing the problems of HTTP/1.1 and how HTTP/2 helps obviate hacks such as bundling, domain sharding, etc. that were required in the HTTP/1.1 world. We will then discuss new architectures and paradigms enabled by features like HTTP/2 PUSH and the caveats to keep in mind when deploying such features to your users. Participants will learn to analyse, measure and optimise common performance problems when deploying such applications by working through the exercises in the workshop. They will also learn how to adapt their front-end tooling to be HTTP/2 ready. Finally, we will be talking about some of the new standards and protocols that are coming up after HTTP/2 and how to remain ahead of the curve. Requirements: Bring your own laptop and chargers

    Have you ever had a bug where things were happening in the wrong order, or particular style changes were being ignored? Ever fixed that bug by wrapping a section of code in a setTimeout? Ever found that fix to be unreliable, and played around with the timeout number until it kinda almost always worked? This talk looks at the browser's event loop, the thing that orchestrates the main thread of the browser, which includes JavaScript, events, and rendering. We'll look at the difference between tasks, microtasks, requestAnimationFrame, requestIdleCallback, and where events land. Hopefully you'll never have to use setTimeout hacks again!"

    If we want to make things work, we need to communicate with other people. We need to talk to our users, audiences, colleagues, clients or even our bosses. We want to share our ideas and make sure they get it, so we can produce work that we're proud of. And right now, in our world, we mainly communicate through text. We talk through 140 characters, chat messages, blog posts or even README documents. We write everyday. But how do you write better? How do you improve your communication so hopefully the other party listens (or reads) and performs the action you wish they do? In this talk, I'd like to share with you what I learned from writing about code for four years – I'll share surprising things I discovered, and how you can improve your communication and get people to take action.

    Chances are that if you work in software, you spend time building applications. Between features, deadlines and bug fixes, it's easy to move performance to be ""nice to have"". But what do you do when user interactions drop off, and users start complaining? Instead of having a traditional, reactive approach to performance — what if we could be proactive instead? What if we could monitor performance continuously, and make informed decisions on which issues to tackle. In this talk, I would like to focus on continuous performance monitoring to tell a story of user interactions. We will look into working with Performance API in your environment, and give you simple methods to tell and read a story of your transactions. We will specifically take a look at creating timings, working with observers, and tracking transactions from frontend to backend.
