    The beast is alive! How do you feel about ASCII-alike CSS Grid layout with polyfluid sizing and ch unit? Do you feel itchy when it comes to building responsive HTML email layouts? What about the brave new world of dynamic static site generators and JAM stack? Have you ever tried to work around nested CSS Custom Properties, untamed 3rd-party scripts, shady service workers, multi-dimensional variable fonts and painfully outdated pattern libraries? Well, let’s bring it on, If you attended or watched the first season (last year), you better tighten up your seatbelts, it's an entirely different session, with a slightly different cast and a dash of dirty little front-end tricks. Beware, you will not be able to unlearn what you’ll learn in the session! Ah, one more thing, take the techniques with a grain of salt — we do not take responsibility for sleepless nights and nightmares caused by the content of this session.

    The VoiceFirst revolution is taking hold, but voice experiences are still very limited and one dimensional. In the next 2-5 years, voice technology will becomes more robust to really support context and personalization, and be able to create empowering and frictionless multidimensional experiences like never before. In this talk, Karen will build on her 20+ years of experience designing interactive voice experiences to share a glimpse of the future - when the walls and windows are our screens, when voice can unlock the potential for interactive media, and when our conversational assistants can truly act on our behalf. If you are new to designing for voice, this talk will lay the groundwork as you embark on designing an Alexa Skill or an Action for Google Home. And for those that have some experience under their belt, Karen builds on some of the principles, opportunities and challenges for designing voice experiences today to explore voice in different industries, and new experiences in the future.

    I'd love tell other front-end developers about the topic that blew my mind last year. First of all, current state of design tooling is fascinating (how and why Photoshop was replaced by Sketch, UXPin, Framer etc.). Secondly, I'd like to show how perfectly these tools fit into the current front-end trend of building everything using components (react/vuejs/web). Finally, I'd like to go over some tools that can help close the gap, react-sketchapp (from AirBnB) and html-sketchapp (that I build).

    Once you have grasped the basics of CSS Grid, you quickly discover how it enables many existing design patterns in a streamlined, elegant way. However, we shouldn’t see Grid in isolation. Understanding how other parts of CSS work together with Grid is key, in order to get the most out of our new abilities. In this talk Rachel will be concentrating on a couple of these areas, CSS Box Alignment and CSS Sizing. Rachel will show you practical ways in which a little bit of knowledge in these areas can unlock the full potential of the Grid Specification. You’ll learn how to create useful components and to start thinking of ways in which you can solve design and interface problems in more creative ways.

    You probably heard about serverless, and many things about its autoscaling and price. But no one told you one of the most important things, serverless is backend thing, but it gives superpowers to the frontend developers. Why? Because it put the deployment in hands of frontend developers, without all the complexity of backend systems. You can deploy simple API that is production ready, server side rendering or full Google Chrome and do amazing things with just a few lines of code. This talk is about serverless, and about the ways you can benefit it as a frontend developer.

In this session we'll take an online-only site and turn it into a fully network-resilient, offline-first installable progressive web app, and this won't involve rebuilding from scratch; it'll be done in small iterations, with each step improving the user experience whether they're offline, online, or anything in between. This session will cover ServiceWorker, web manifests, add-to-homescreen banners, IndexedDB and BackgroundSync APIs.

    There’s a ton of advice out there for junior developers, how to grow your skills, how to contribute effectively without a lot of experience, how to ask good questions. Likewise, there’s a lot of good advice for senior developers on how lead and mentor effectively and how to leverage their knowledge and experience. Left out are the people in between those two extremes, the developers who aren’t junior anymore, but haven’t risen to truly “senior developer” status.How do you get from junior to senior? Perhaps it's just a matter of time, Junior Dev + 5 years = Senior Dev? Is it some combination of depth and breadth of knowledge? Are team skills or technical ones the most important in this transition? How do you know you've crossed into senior territory? For that matter, how do you know you're no longer a junior? Let’s explore this squishy middle area, its landmarks and signposts, and try to find a personalized map of the mid-career.

It might mean saying something in a way that hasn’t been said before, or fundamentally changing how you others with the world.

    More and more, we hear design and agile software development in the same sentence. Many flavors of agile have borrowed from design practices successfully and agile practices have been influencing design methods for a long time. While there are many overlapping areas, there are fundamental differences between agile software development and design practices. In this talk we will see how designers and agile developers can work together by recognizing that strategic, discovery-based design and production-level design are two vastly different activities. We will talk about how to run a parallel discovery track, and how to make production-level design a part of the agile process. We will discuss how to adapt to different team structures and project needs and share tips about how you can communicate this hybrid approach to your designers, developers, PMs and QA teams. Participants who are new to agile practices will get a chance to see how agile practices developed historically and how they compare to mature design practices. Designers and developers will get a chance to see agile approaches from a different perspective. Experienced practitioners will get a chance to see successful variations on the dual-track approaches that have been tested in large enterprise and small agency settings.

    It’s no secret that most people don’t read technical documentation for pleasure. Users often come to your docs when they are frustrated with your software, disappointed that they haven't been able to solve the problem on their own and generally feeling pretty low. This is a little sad, yeah, but being aware of these feelings is key for developers and technical writers. These emotions frame the reader’s perspective and therefore, should shape the mood of our docs. After all, when you've been stuck on a bug for hours, do you really want to read something saying 'but this is so easy'? In this talk, we’ll discuss how the language we use affects our users and the first steps towards writing accessible, approachable and use case-driven documentation.

    Effective feedback is the most high-impact method of improving individual and team performance. When it is given well and received willingly, feedback can be a powerful ally in growing happy teams who work together effectively to deliver great software. Here's the challenge, giving and receiving feedback are skills, and many of us haven't had the chance to develop those skills. Maybe we find giving feedback intimidating. Maybe receiving feedback makes us feel defensive. Maybe we simply haven't had much positive experience with open, honest conversations about performance. It's not easy to do feedback "right", and when it is given badly or received poorly, feedback can cause a team's relationships to disintegrate. This talk will introduce the fundamentals of effective feedback; provide strategies for giving, receiving, and processing feedback; and discuss the challenges and rewards of using feedback as a tool to improve team performance.
