We will go through the main problems that I and my team encountered during the development of the application, the features of the environment and the solutions to which we have come. Consider the most popular plugins for Cordova that allow you to read user information, work with User access and interactions, store data and create Internet calls using WebRTC. There will be a lot of interesting and instructive.

    DRY (Don’t repeat yourself) is the most frequently violated principle in microservices. For avoiding this issue you can use reusable components, private npm packages for example. Best practices what will help you to achieve this are ECB (entity, control, boundary) pattern, 12 factor manifest, code generation. In our project we use technical stack based on Node.js, Docker, RabbitMQ, but ideas from this talk can be used for any microservice's technical stack

    JavaScript is everywhere! Just recently I was trying to run the same JS code in Browser, Node.js, and React Native, and now a new challenge occurred - Embedded systems… Keep calm, JS can handle this! During this demo I’ll be talking about JS engines that can work in such limited environments, show some production usage examples, and how fun it is to develop embedded software using JS. [Spoiler] If all goes well, we’ll hack a regular Bluetooth key tag to play the Mario ringtone :)

With more and more emerging markets coming online, and more and more apps moving to the web platform, we’re reaching an intersection where connections are getting slower and websites are getting heavier. In this talk, we’ll learn just what these emerging markets mean to us, and how we can begin to move in the right direction.

    Compass is a MongoDB user interface tool written for Electron using NodeJS and React. So what happens if a user has a feature request we can’t support? We let them do it themselves! This talk is about how we implemented a plugin architecture for Compass so that users can write their own features. I will demo Compass, describe the plugin architecture, and then live-code an example plugin. Attendees who are interested in writing their own plugin architecture will learn about how we solved the specific problems with supporting external plugins in an Electron app. I will also explore the security implications of having third-party plugins and the unique challenges involved with supporting open-source plugins in a closed-source project. Writing a Compass plugin is a lot of fun, as well as a great way to get to know React, Node, MongoDB. Attendees will leave the talk with an understanding of how the Compass plugin architecture works and how to start writing their own plugin.

    If you have a huge amount of data to deliver quickly you might have tried using web sockets to do so. However, sockets are hard to maintain and scale, not to mention multiplex. In this presentation I do comparison of the three methods of delivering data to the front-end. Server-Sent Events gives you the ability to deliver your content with less overhead on the infrastructural side. In this talk I will cover SSE, Long-Polling, and Web-Sockets with their pros and cons, including technical demo. We will touch a bit on connectionless push and available optimizations for the mobile network.

    Building complex applications that run in the terminal can be tricky. They usually have a ton of state and if you want to update the terminal output you have to understand things like ANSI codes or frameworks like ncurses. What if, instead, we used a simple approach, similar to writing React web apps, where you always render your entire application but then use a framework that can figure only to update the small diff that actually changed. That's exactly what the diffy framework does! I this talk I'll talk about fun command line apps and do live coding to show how easy they are to write.

    One of the most common questions one comes by nowadays is, when is React going to die? I’ll admit that fortune telling is not my strong side, but we can make assumptions based on the past. Technologies in the Front-end world don’t have a very long life cycle, changes are always occuring and things are constantly on the go. In this talk, I’ll give a brief history of the library - where it started out, what’s been done and how it became so popular. We’ll discuss its modern infrastructure and how it spreaded to different platforms such as: RN, React VR and loads more. All of those, live in totally different ecosystems with different problems, approaches and practices. Hopefully, by the end of the talk we’ll be able to forecast the future of React, how we can interpolate it into other industries and let our minds fly!
