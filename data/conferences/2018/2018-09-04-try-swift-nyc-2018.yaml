In this talk I will walk you through some of the new thing from Face Tracking and how you can create your own memoji using ARKit 2.

      Swift on the server has been talked about since Swift was open sourced. There have been a lot of efforts to make Swift on the server viable. However, when building a product, you should be focused on your product, not on the tools and frameworks backing it. This talk evaluates the holistic experience of building a small (but real) backend in Swift, versus a few well known frameworks in other languages, and tries to answer the age old question: Are we there yet?

      Siri Shortcuts help to improve your user experience by making actions available with Siri in iOS, watchOS, CarPlay and HomePod. We can set up our apps to give easy access to frequent actions without needing to open the app. Even better, iOS can suggest frequently used actions pro-actively using notifications or the lock screen. We’ll see how to add custom Siri Shortcuts to our apps, how to expose them so that Siri can recommend them, and how to let users set up their own voice commands to access their favourite Shortcuts.

      You want to add ML to your apps but you think you need to study a lot of math and write Python and you can’t find the time? Think again: Apple’s Create ML gets you started in the comfort of Xcode and Swift! No math needed :]. Create ML is brilliant for getting you started with ML. It makes it easy to try different datasets — getting your data right is actually the hardest and most time consuming part of ML. Once you get started with ML, you won’t want to wait / hope for Apple to add more models to Create ML. To help you explore the ML universe that’s written in Python, I’ll reduce the fright factor by comparing Create ML Swift with Turi Create Python, and showing you how to quick-start your exploration of Turi Create. And I’ll point you to Keras and scikit-learn, in case you want to roll your own models.

       Ever look at an app and think, 'I wonder how I'd build that?' After scrolling through Instagram looking at cat photos, I decided to try my hand at building some of its features to determine how I'd tackle common development challenges. In this talk I share what I learned, including tips for designing a scalable data structure in a NoSQL database and implementing smooth scrolling with dynamically downloaded images.

Felix will talk about the risks of depending on external code, and how an attacker can easily inject malicious code in software you bundle within your app.Felix is the creator of fastlane, an open source toolset for automating all your iOS and Android development tasks. He joined Twitter in 2015, and recently started working at Google, where he now works full-time on open source tooling for mobile app developers. Before that Felix worked at various startups in Europe and in the U.S. where he collected over 6 years of experience in the iOS ecosystem.

      Peter founded and bootstrapped PSPDFKit in 2011, and has since expanded the company with the goal of providing the highest quality PDF framework for all platforms. While Peter is responsible for the day-to-day management of the team, he never misses the chance to go under PSPDFKit’s hood and get his hands dirty with writing and debugging code. Peter has worked with iOS since the inception of the iPhone, and is regularly invited to speak at conferences around the world. He also organizes Cocoaheads, a meetup for developers that work with Apple platforms. Prior to PSPDFKit, he worked as a Senior iOS Engineer at a startup in San Francisco and taught iOS and Mac development at his alma mater, the Vienna University of Technology.

      The ‘Super Resolution' technique is used for converting low resolution images into high resolution, which reduces the amount of image data that needs to be transferred. In this talk, I'd like to show you the implementation of super resolution with CoreML and Swift, and compare the results with conventional methods. I’ll also talk about how to train your own model using your own data step by step. In addition, I’d like to introduce recent topics such as Turi Create, Swift for TensorFlow, CoreML2 and CreateML, which will be enhanced in iOS 12 and I’ll look at how iOS will take advantage of machine learning technology in the future.

      In an increasingly fast-paced society, users demand immediate satisfaction from their products. When they tap on a mobile app icon they expect it to launch in four seconds or less. With 23% of users abandoning an app after first use, there’s not a second to spare in making a great first impression. See how much of The Knot’s loading time was eaten up by our asset catalogs and what we did about it.

The good news is that Swift is open source and we, the community have the power to fix it. In this talk, I’ll discuss how to pitch an idea in Swift Forums, submit a Proposal, and how to build, test and benchmark Swift using the example of Dictionary.compactMapValues that I proposed and got merged for Swift 5.
