      As a graphic designer, I'm lucky to make stuff for all kinds of stuff. But more and more, I'm realizing the profound impact it has on the stuff in the rest of my life. Stuff in my backyard. Stuff that holds stuff. Stuff on the open road. Stuff in my bank account. Stuff for my nephew. Stuff with our family's stuff. Stuff for people I'll never meet. And stuff on one of the saddest days of my life. That's a lot of stuff. Plus, we'll update you on all the stuff we've been up to, aside from all this stuff. Tons of new stuff!

      Once you have grasped the basics of CSS Grid, you quickly discover how it enables many existing design patterns in a streamlined, elegant way. However, we shouldn’t see Grid in isolation. Understanding how other parts of CSS work together with Grid is key, in order to get the most out of our new abilities. In this talk Rachel will be concentrating on a couple of these areas, CSS Box Alignment and CSS Sizing. Rachel will show you practical ways in which a little bit of knowledge in these areas can unlock the full potential of the Grid Specification. You’ll learn how to create useful components and to start thinking of ways in which you can solve design and interface problems in more creative ways.

      What do an overnight 40% drop in road accidents, a night in on the couch watching TV and a good night’s sleep have to do with digital product design? Humans only have limited mental capacity and no-one is ever operating at 100%. We are all influenced by the world around us and by how our minds work. As designers we need to be able to understand this and design for it. To help you understand how psychology can transform your designs, we’ll look at, The micro Psychology to optimize Interaction Design. How psychology can help design the perfect search UI and how to apply to psychology to design bullet-proof UIs. The macro Psychology to transform the User Experience. How to use psychology to create innovative user experiences and transform digital product design After the talk, you’ll be able to, Design product, app and website UIs that match how people think and behave. Apply a framework to design innovative digital products. Make better, informed design decisions and advocate to the wider team using psychology theory.

      How many third-party scripts are loading on our web pages these days? How can we objectively measure the value of these (advertising, a/b testing, analytics, etc.) scripts — considering their impact on web performance, user experience, and business goals? We’ve learned to scrutinize content hierarchy, browser support, and page speed as part of the design and development process. Similarly, Trent will share recent experiences and explore ways to evaluate and discuss the inclusion of 3rd-party scripts.

      Optimizing sites to load instantly on mobile is far from trivial. Costly JavaScript can take seconds to process, we often aren't sensitive to users data-plans and browsers don't know what UX-critical resources should load first. Thankfully there's a lot we can do to give our users a MUCH better loading experience. Watch Addy Osmani (and friends) illuminate new loading best practices for diagnosing and making real world sites load instantly today.

      There is a growing myth in the web industry. We’re facing challenges on several fronts, there aren’t enough designers, Wall Street demands ever increasing scale, people not able to make good design decisions are making them every day, and businesses are turning to design systems to solve these problems. And they do. But at what cost? In this talk, Mark will walk through the many pitfalls in creating, deploying and sustaining design systems and how you can avoid them.

      Media queries have always been a cornerstone of responsive design but the role of media queries is changing. It's now possible to make websites with responsive properties that are not tied to specific breakpoints. Learn how to use fluid typography, responsive SVG, adaptive flexbox components, CSS grid and custom properties to create unique responsive solutions that go beyond media queries.

      Kate Dawkins has projected onto a floor of ice, the ceiling of the London Design Museum, the bridge of the USS intrepid in NY and put content onto the smallest amount of LEDs to create one of the largest screens for the London 2012 Olympics ceremonies. It goes without saying that each project requires a unique approach. But that approach encompasses so many variants. These large-scale projects are inevitably a roller-coaster ride of design, decision making, blood, sweat and sometimes, just sometimes tears! Kate is a designer and director that approaches each project applying logic to the problem and a passion to the solution. She’ll be sharing an insight into how she works, some of the experiences she’s encountered over the years and how she approaches some of the more challenging aspects of these experiential projects.

      Home, understood as “the place where one lives permanently as a member of a household” is no longer a physical space for a vast group of people. Many of us find comfort in digital environments and use them for work and leisure and sometimes support.This talk aims to dig deeper into that relationship over time and discuss the key factors that will help designers keep and improve that connection between their products and their users.

      In the multi-cultural region of Southeast Asia, writing systems go in all directions, in books and newspapers, store-fronts and signage. The digital world, however, is predominantly left-to-right, and this always felt like a bit of a disconnect. Fortunately, today’s web has evolved to a point where it is no longer a tall task to render non-Latin characters and writing systems correctly. Modern CSS allows us to typeset for a dynamic medium, even for a language as complex as Chinese, with its tens of thousands of characters. And these same techniques can be extended to build layouts that were simply not feasible just a few years back. This talk aims to inspire designers and developers to eschew cookie-cutter web layouts and create designs that truly embrace the nature of the web.

      The design and presentation of data is just as important as the underlying algorithm, and designers have an urgent role to play in crafting the emerging generation of AI interfaces. Designer Josh Clark explores a rich trove of examples—at once entertaining and sobering—to unearth design principles for creating responsible machine-learning applications. Learn to use AI as design material in your everyday work. Adapt to the machines’ weird, unexpected, or flat-out-wrong conclusions. And above all, scrub data for bias to create the respectful and inclusive world we all want to live in.
