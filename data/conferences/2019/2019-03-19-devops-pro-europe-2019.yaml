      Monitoring systems is hard. Monitoring large systems is even harder. What do you do when your (good) monitoring detects that something is wrong? Alert the on-call with all you’ve got! What do the on-call engineers do? Panic! This is bound to happen unless you build a positive and productive experience for the on-call engineers. We’re here to tell you about the tools and practices that we develop to make on-call a healthy activity at Uber.

      "Cynefin (meaning ‘habitat’ in Welsh) is a sense-making framework, developed by Dave Snowden, and used for improving situational awareness and helping with decision-making by managers and hands-on professionals in various industries, including IT. The framework differentiates between ordered and unordered systems and introduces five domains (simple, complicated, complex, chaotic, and disorder) that make it easier to identify the best next steps in any (challenging) situation. The session introduces the basic concepts in Cynefin and describes its applicability to IT management and DevOps. We will cover the following: – Supporting organisational change initiatives and transformation programs – How to recognise your context and choose suitable methods – How to make decisions in complex environments – How to avoid ‘one size fits all’ approaches – How to enable and support innovation – How to support continual improvement"

      "The syslog-ng application collects logs from many different sources, performs real-time log analysis by processing and filtering them, and finally it stores the logs, or forwards them for further analysis. It was originally developed in C due to its low footprint and high performance. Recently Python language bindings were added, so you can collect, process, and store log messages using embedded Python code. DevOps engineers often use syslog-ng due to its low footprint and high performance. The new Python bindings make it easy to extend syslog-ng without touching the core of the application or requiring a complex development development environment. Python bindings always have two parts: a configuration part – where you configure a source, parser, or destination – and the actual Python code part. You can store the code in-line in the syslog-ng configuration file, or in external files, if you have a larger project. Obviously the Python code is slower than native C code. On the other hand, extending syslog-ng in Python offers a lot more flexibility than development in C. It is easy to get started, as there is no need for extra setup. You can get proof-of-concept minimal setup working with a single method quickly. You can extend it later to have proper initialization and connection control for added robustness. Learn how to customize your log processing infrastructure in Python using syslog-ng, integrate your logs to local and cloud services, and the implementation details and benefits of such solutions."

      "Embracing DevOps entails more than just shipping changes to production faster and faster. Your team is suddenly also responsible for monitoring your software in production and detecting and troubleshooting issues. To work together with operation specialists in your team or maybe even embrace a #NoOps approach, you as the developer, need to learn about monitoring. We will discuss logging frameworks and log analytics solutions. Next to that we will explore metrics: your software’s KPI’s. What metrics to choose and how to gather them. To let information come to us, we will use both logging and metrics to create dashboards and alerts that notify us when things go south. Or better yet: before things go south! Finally, we will combine all of this to see how we can quickly investigate and resolve production issues. Join Henry Been for a demo heavy session, including like NLog, Application Insights, Seq and more to see how to implement all of the above from scratch. During this session, you will learn everything you need to know to start monitoring your solutions and never lose any sleep ever again!"

      Websites these days strive to get your attention in the hopes that you will stick around long enough to buy a product or two from them. But, not all websites take security as seriously as they should. Dave has seen websites for financial services organizations that only permitted a 4 character password, ones that would expose customer data with a simple trick. These are just some examples that Dave has been through in which he will highlight the errors that can happen when deploying a site. He will provide examples of poor implementations, code errors discuss how security can be better deployed.

      We can’t discuss automation and DevOps without discussing Continuous Integration and Deployment. At Camunda, we develop open-source software for workflow automation and, over the years, we’ve built an extensive CI/CD system based on Jenkins. Today our biggest instance has more than 2,500 jobs. On top of that, our other projects manage Jenkins instances autonomously, relying on Kubernetes. Reaching this scale was a challenge in terms of organization, performance and scalability. The infrastructure team at Camunda had to evaluate different solutions and find ways to manage such a complex scenario, while giving developers the right degree of freedom and trust. During his talk, Andrea will explain how his team is able to manage all these environments and which approach they found most successful for their use case.

      Development is always changing. The software frameworks we use go in and out of fashion all the time, but how much has the process of development itself changed in recent history? Developing new ways of development has to happen to move software forward. The talk is about the type of innovation whose technology is already proven, but has barely reached mainstream development yet – Innovations in the areas of security and semantic code analysis, mixed with the advancements in machine-learning on large development activity data sets and Open Source community research. The audience will (hopefully) leave with a believable vision for what coding might look like for the next generation and get an idea what kind of programming jobs will continue to exist in 5 years and what programming tasks will already be partially automated by robots.

Augusto’s talk is part experience and part rant on things many services seem always to do. After this talk, you will be an expert in his reliability lessons from the Mission Impossible of running digital services reliability. You can take those with you and apply slowly to your practices. Some of these lessons improved uptime and reliability at many of the services Augusto worked in the last decade. Finally, he will review the latest news and tricks of running reliable services, including Google’s Site Reliability Engineering and Netflix Chaos Engineering practices.

      "Knative is a Kubernetes-based platform to build, deploy, and manage modern serverless workloads. It provides a set of middleware components that are essential to build modern, source-centric, and container-based applications that can run anywhere: on premises, in the cloud, or even in a third-party data center. Knative components are built on Kubernetes and codify the best practices shared by successful real-world Kubernetes-based frameworks. Each of the components under the Knative project attempt to identify common patterns and codify the best practices that are shared by successful real-world Kubernetes-based frameworks and applications. Knative components focus on solving many mundane but difficult tasks such as: – Deploying a container – Orchestrating source-to-URL workflows on Kubernetes – Routing and managing traffic with blue/green deployment – Automatic scaling and sizing workloads based on demand – Binding running services to eventing ecosystems This talk describes how Knative enables you to focus just on writing interesting code, without worrying about the “boring but difficult”parts of building, deploying, and managing an application. It shows how developers can even use familiar idioms, languages, and frameworks to deploy any workload: functions, applications, or containers."

      "Many organizations are adopting DevOps patterns and practices, and are enjoying the benefits that come from that adoption: More speed. Higher quality. Better value. However, many teams often get stymied when dealing with information security, compliance, and audit requirements. There seems to be a misconception that DevOps practices won’t work in large organizations which are under regulations or have their own strict processes. DevOps actually helps teams meet compliance standards because automation is not only an integral part of DevOps, but a great way to make sure development and deploy practices are reliable, repeatable, and traceable. In this talk I’ll get you from lengthy cycle times and feedback loops to getting things done again. We will look at both the soft and technical practices. I will cover branch policies, checks you can do during your build and deployment, Azure Security Center and more."

      "Join me in this talk about why high workload leads to increasing waiting times and is detrimental to your project’s success. We will not only talk about queuing theory and capacity management, but also about devops strategies to cope with high utilization and how to start a virtuous circle. Teams often find themselves in high workload situations, showing symptoms of overload and being to busy to implement the necessary changes or adopt the state-of-the-art tools to get the upper hand. This is a story of how we applied the Three Ways of DevOps to get out of a state we referred to as quicksand (The more you fight it, the more it pulls you in). I will not only talk about queueing theory and capacity management, but also about DevOps strategies to cope with high utilization and how to start a virtuous circle. Key Takeaways are: * Crisis situations are opportunities for change * Often it takes fresh eyes or at least courage to see the problems * High workload leads to increasing waiting times * Get out of the quicksand with devops: * Quantify the work and set goals * Measure * Less is more * Automate the right things * Establish a continuous improvement process * Start a virtuous circle"

The flexible nature of Kubernetes makes it an ideal platform to run CI/CD pipelines, dynamically and efficiently. In this talk we’ll explore the advantages kubernetes provides in regards to automation and CI/CD, the difficulties and pain points, and finally the workarounds and hacks to glue all the pieces together.

      "The recent technological improvements have make it really difficult to properly monitor application performances. Luckily great tools such as Elastic APM are taking care of the problem efficiently. Learn in this presentation how to diagnose, analyse and monitor your applications using Elastic APM. In correlation with the fast paced technological evolution, software applications have also evolved to become more complex, more distributed and more dynamic. Cloud computing has pushed this evolution a step further. Therefore it is now more difficult to properly monitor application performances and ensure the end user that he will get the high-quality experience he is expecting. Luckily great tools such as Elastic APM are taking care of the problem efficiently. In this presentation I will introduce the audience to Elastic APM and then I will show them how to integrate it to their Spring boot applications and how to diagnose, analyse and monitor their applications. They will become familiar with the use of Elastic APM main components: the agent, the server and the user interface. I will show the audience how to instrument your applications to ship performance metrics to Elasticsearch in order to visualise them with Kibana’s pre-configured or customised dashboards. They will also learn how to analyse user request from the invocation sequence and detect the root causes of potential problems. They will learn by using the Elastic APM dedicated UI to identify bottlenecks and by taking advantage of the ELK Stack, to spot the code level related issues. They will finally see how easy it is to perform real time monitoring with Elastic APM in a production like environment."

What are the benefits of going serverless on MySQL? From AWS to Google Cloud, the major cloud providers offer different options to run a MySQL or a MySQL compatible database on the cloud. You can spin up virtual machines and configure your own cluster or rely on managed services with the ability to modify or scale vertically a database with the click of a button. From sharding to backups, from provisioning to monitoring, the talk will cover the operational costs of running relational databases on the cloud on a personal journey from virtual machines to running a serverless database."

      This talk introduces Traefik, an open source edge router which is used as a dynamic reverse proxy. Simplicity and automation are key concepts, so developers don’t waste time configuring or renewing SSL certificates. Traefik removes the need to update routing configurations by interfacing to backends such as Kubernetes, Docker, Mesos, and Consul, providing dynamic configuration. We will define what an edge router, a reverse proxy and a load-balancer are. Then we’ll present the concepts and features of Traefik and how to use it. Finally, we’ll dig deeper and show how we made Traefik distributed, scalable and fault tolerant.

      "One of the core responsibilities of DevOps is to keep the highest standard of availability and accessibility of infrastructure. And the help here comes from where it is not obvious to expect it to come: from data. Smart Data-driven Alerts is a concept which monitors a current state of application data (e.g. using pure SQL queries) and sends immediate alerts in case of deviations.Artem will share a way how his company does it now. His session also includes a live demo."

      In this talk Bas Peters will give an overview and demo of GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions are a new way to automate your workflows as code hosted, shared and executed on GitHub.com. GitHub Actions apply open source principles to workflow automation allowing you to share and discover actions to use in your workflows. You can use them to build and test your code, to package and deploy, to send notifications on specific events like creating a release or to automate welcoming new users to your open source projects. We think GitHub Actions are going to have a big impact on software development and we would love to hear your feedback and ideas.

      Startups provide a unique landscape for DevOps. On one hand, a startup is a blank slate allowing you build the infrastructure you’ve dreamed of. On the other, the “fail fast” mentality of startups governed by growth, marketing, and limited capital. Balancing the two can be tricky. In this talk, I’ll show you how I break startups into 3 distinct stages and the DevOps tooling, philosophy, and culture that works best for each stage.

      Automated unit, integration and acceptance tests are essential quality controls in running a reliable continuous integration or continuous delivery pipeline. Too often, security tests are left out of this process because of the erroneous belief that security testing is solely the domain of leather-jacket-wearing security experts. The talk covers how easy it could be to integrate security aspects into a continuous delivery livecycle.

      Building and deploying apps with Azure DevOps is a breeze. You can can quickly define environments and create steps that have to be performed. When building his latest app however Benny’s team was faced with a hard requirement which defined that data and the processing of it had to be physically separated per tenant. This basically means rolling out a unique environment per tenant. In this session he’ll show you the solution we came up with and how you still be able to leverage Azure DevOps and Azure AD in a dynamic fashion to create environments on demand and keep them up to date.

Testing, Quality Assurance and delivering quality. It all radically changed over the last few years. This all because of our new agile way of creating software. Now the last evolution called DevOps has been taking the stage more & more in the last 2 years. But how do you really deliver quality if changes go faster, when we are all working together & we are not supposed to be only testing. So what is the new role of testing? During this presentation we will take a look at:  – What are the good practices we need to keep; – What are the things we need to forget from the olden days; – What new things do we need to learn; -How will we get there? – Do we still need manual testers?  – How does it work for big banks like ING & Rabobank? During this presentation Geoffrey will give insight in practices and answer all questions raised above. Furthermorehewill show what are the biggest pitfalls of companieshe  hs consulted. All these things can help you to build software ‘first time right’ while being faster. But, most importantly, the presentation itself, it will be full of the most powerful tool for future DevOps development: examples!"

What about the developers that hate it when the pipeline is red due to false positives? And how do you secure the pipeline itself? These are all questions that need to be addressed to make sure that the automation becomes sustainable. Jeroen has distilled multiple best practices after having experienced various security automation implementation projects. Whether you are starting with security automation or are already at an advanced level. In this talk Jeroen will share his experience from various security automation implementation projects. Skip all the trials and learn to make a security CI\CD pipeline work.

      Staging environments are notoriously difficult to setup and maintain. Unless you have a top notch DevOps team, staging environments are usually different from production environments, and because of that, are fraught with problems -from failing deployments, to out of disk space errors, and various other errors. Even when the staging environment is great, it has one problem – there’s only one. If you want to test a feature branch, you have to “allocate time”, or alternatively install the feature branch and risk disrupting other testers. It’s time the testers took control! And build their own testing environments using Docker, Docker-Compose, and Kubernetes. In this talk, I will show how to deploy an app on your local machine using Docker and Docker Compose, and run an E2E test on it. I will also describe the necessary changes needed to make the application deployable in such a setup – turning it into a Twelve-Factor Application.

While the benefits of this are mostly seen by means of pull/merge requests, easy “undo” functionality, team collaboration and others, the real benefit is history. When did we change this piece of code, and more importantly: why? By using clever commit message and branch strategies, you can reconstruct the way your or your colleagues’ brain was thinking a year ago! It will help you pinpoint the exact ticket where a client requested a specific change and by who it was sanctioned. Start keeping a diary today, and write history!"

      OK, OK, you get Microservices! Gil is not going to preach about the benefits and problems with Microservice-based architecture. You can find hundreds of those talks online. What Gil is going to show is how his company implemented a Microservice project. The nuts and bolts of creating a repo with all the microservices, the structure of the code of each microservice, and creating packages with the common code. Also how to build a docker image from these microservices, how we test the whole thing, how we build the project, how we deploy it in production, and how we monitor it. It’s going to be a really boring talk, full of lots of tips they learned in blood in the last year of implementing this. So be prepared to be bored! And, hopefully, educated…

      The software world moves faster than ever. In order to stay competitive, new software versions need to be rolled out as soon as possible, without disrupting active users. Many enterprises have moved their workloads to Kubernetes, which has been built with production-readiness in mind. However, in order to achieve real zero-downtime with Kubernetes, without breaking or loosing a single in-flight request, we need to take a few more steps. This session shows what it takes to deploy and update Java Enterprise applications with minimal user disruption. We will see how to detect gaps in our deployments and how to enhance our applications as well as our Kubernetes deployments to close these gaps. We’ll also see how to upgrade cluster nodes without causing the running applications to go dark. All of the time will be spent live-demoing.

      "The DevOps approach has revolutionised the operations world. However, something tends to get forgotten about in this new approach: Security. With a move to quick feedback loops, getting things done faster and failing faster, there’s a tendency to let security fall by the way-side. Sometimes that little question keeps coming up: Let’s do it this way… what’s the worst that could happen? But fear not! Security doesn’t have to be a casualty in the world of DevOps, and we’ll be discussing how you can ensure that a move to a DevOps culture is still safe and secure. We’ll be talking about keeping secrets, detecting when changes and how to integrate security into your planning processes, and whether the new DevSecOps term is actually useful."
