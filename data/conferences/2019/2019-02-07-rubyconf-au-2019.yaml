      Business is slow for Ruby Private Investigator, Deirdre Bug. She’s on the verge of switching industry when she gets a call from an anxious young man. "Some class methods have gone missing," he tells her breathlessly. "I need your help."Deirdre takes the case and begins exploring Ruby objects behind the scenes. Though she thinks she's on familiar ground — Ruby's object model, method lookup — she's about to discover that she really has no clue.

      Software development is the anticipation of a thousand dangers: regressions, edge-cases, exceptions, attacks, downtime, the list is endless. Drawing from a wide range of disciplines, we’ll build a simple model for quantifying danger, explore why the human brain is so bad at it, and examine some practical applications for our development processes. There will be at least one science.

This talk turns that perspective on its head and asks, “what can I do to prevent this scenario?"Keith Pitty has been developing software professionally for more than three decades. Since 2000 he has maintained a keen interest in Agile approaches and for the last ten years has made many contributions to the Australian Ruby community. He has been fascinated by how developers consider other people when developing software since his early days of programming on mainframes. Away from computers he enjoys golf, is a cricket tragic and a passionate Collingwood supporter.

There are four types to choose from storytelling, status, analytical and exploratory. I’ll help you find the perfect one.Mila is a data geek that loves data visualisations. Especially if the data visualisation is related to cats. Ruby is still her favourite language because of the community and how expressive it is. When she's not coding, you’ll find Mila cruising on an electric skateboard.

      In this talk we will discuss algorithmic thinking in everyday life in language we can all understand. We will explore widely applicable algorithms, and how they reveal themselves in our everyday lives, so that we better understand what when and how we can use them in our programs.Elle is a full stack web developer with more than ten years experience writing Ruby and Rails. Currently at Blackmill, previously she was Development Director at thoughtbot New York. Elle believes in writing clean code, driven by automatic tests, with agile practices, an even work/life balance, and a respectful and inclusive team culture. Recently, she developed and ran the apprenticeship program for Hooroo, up-skilling less experienced developers. When she is not immersed in the Ruby community, she is probably immersed in water, or lately, in bread flour.

      How are you supposed to sing along with your favorite TV theme song every week if it doesn't have lyrics? At my house, we "meow" along (loudly). We also code, so I built 'Meowifier' to convert any song into a cat's meows. Join me in this exploration of melody analysis APIs and gratuitous cat gifs.I built an application that takes a song's audio and outputs a new audio file with that song's melody **sung by cats**. It's a technical feat. It's hilarious. It's beautiful. It's a new way to waste time on the internet.[Beth](https://www.bethanyhaubert.com/) is a software engineer who loves Ruby, little-known APIs, handcrafting SQL queries, and as many monitors on her desk as possible. She’s also a former airborne cryptologic linguist for the US Air Force, fluent in Mandarin. Things you can ask her about include cats, board games, karaoke, and building applications that convert songs into auto-tuned cat meows. Things she'll have to kill you if you ask her about: the airborne linguist part. Also, she likes to make emojis look like they're farting
