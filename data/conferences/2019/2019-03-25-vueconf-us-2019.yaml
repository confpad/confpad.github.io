      EvanWe’ve learned a lot since deploying our first Vue.js app in production over one year ago. I’d love to share our experience shipping Vue.js to desktop and mobile devices and leveling up our engineering team in the process. I’ll discuss lessons learned from deprecating AngularJS and Bower to adopting Vue.js and deploying an internal NPM repo. I’ll talk about the benefits we’ve seen with Vue.js by providing real stories from the volunteers that upgraded our tooling and the engineers that build the apps today. This is how Optoro upgraded its enterprise front-ends with Vue.js.

      JenVue single file components empowers developers with the ability to write declarative render functions using plain HTML-like syntax. The so-called SFCs also provide features like collocation and scoped styles. We tend to use these SFCs effortlessly as any other JavaScript file but to reach that level of ease, Vue does the heavy lifting of transpilation. This talk takes a deep dive in the compilation process of Vue components and explains how to write a custom block processor. It also discovers some less known facts about SFCs.

      Input masking is a common pattern in form design that guide users to enter information in the correct format in a consistent manner. Typically this involves formatting user input according to the type of data they represent like dates, phone numbers, addresses and credit card numbers. You can achieve an input mask in Vue by leaning heavily Vue’s reactivity system chiefly methods, computed, and watchers. In this talk, we will cover the distinction between the various components that make up Vue’s reactivity system and how to leverage it in order to create semantic and robust input elements that respond seamlessly to user feedback
