      Struggling to get your website to load in less than 5 seconds on a mobile phone? Switching pages are a little sluggish? You’re not alone! Most web developers can build a responsive site, but fail to meet performance requirements for mobile. Using the latest PRPL pattern and Progressive Web API’s, you can provide a compelling alternative to native apps, as long as performance remains your top feature.This talk will cover the architecture for Xfinity xFi, an enterprise PWA for Comcast, built with Google Polymer. We’ll then dive into the Chrome performance tools to optimize xFi loading time down by more than half. You’ll walk away knowing what it takes to create a successful PWA and how to find slow downs in your app startup.

      Developing for multiple platforms is expensive and requires multiple disciplines. Kotlin Multiplatform provides a sane, cheap, and fast method to target multiple environments with the same codebase. Leveraging direct compilation to target environments, Kotlin Multiplatform can save you time and money sharing your business logic between your target platforms. By using a common build tool, you also save considerable learning costs typically associated with writing platform native code. In this talk, we will explore these possibilities and demonstrate how a single multiplatform project can be deployed to multiple target environments.

      This session shows how to develop and run native mobile apps without needing to know much about the native platforms, such as Android and iOS, by leveraging a hybrid development framework such as Ionic, which is built on top of Apache Cordova and is capable of transforming an ordinary web app into a mobile app. The presentation discusses a real-life enterprise-level Android and iOS mobile app developed under pressure for a wireless service provider. It covers some of the technical details of the app as well as how to perform device-level debugging of the Android app, using adb. You’ll get practical tips on what to watch out for, and an understanding of the differences of the hybrid approach versus other frameworks such as React Native and Kotlin/Native.

What about when there are hundreds or thousands of devices, spread across the globe, with limited connectivity and no one around to reset them? When it comes to the Internet of Things, having an understanding of the people, processes, and tools it takes to provision and update devices is a key part of success.

      "How did they do that?!!!" How many times have you been just stunned, STUNNED by the work you see others do in a fully native app? Smooth, layered animations for every transition that work on even $20 phones? Its not magic and it may not be as difficult or as “mathy” as you might think. “Wow” effects that impress and delight! We will be covering how to use multiple ways to accomplish a standard set of animations and much slicker more complicated ones using native and external libraries.From the native side we will cover topics like using animation xml definitions, Material Design AppCompat included tools, moving through Animation Properties, Listeners, View Animators, Animation Sets, even AnimatedVectroDrawables, Morphs, and libraries like Lottie.

      Jupyter notebooks are data science’s favorite new tools, as they combine two things that we typically think of as separate:A human-readable part made of text, images, and even video, all of which combine to form theintroduction, write-up, and summary that you’d expect to find in a paper or report, and An executable part made of code, which provides interactivity, performs calculations and analysis, and can generate live visualizations. It allows readers to explore the data, ask “what if?” questions, and see the results.Jupyter notebooks are tools for people who work with data to collaborate. IBM uses them to “distill data into insights”, Netflix uses them to scale up their ability to work with their copious amounts of data, and you can use them to craft reports that completely show your work — the data you collected, the code you use to process it, along with your writeup of your findings and reasoning.

Have you ever wanted to dip your toes into the NoSQL world? Ever wonder about the hype surrounding NoSQL? What is the difference between MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j, and Cassandra? Get a gentle intro to the NoSQL world and more importantly, when to use it and when not to use it. More important, we will discuss decision metrics for picking a cloud-based NoSQL solution that is right for you; between major cloud providers like Google (Datastore), Amazon (DynamoDB), and Microsoft (Azure CosmosDB). We'll have a spirited discussion on why cloud based/managed NoSQL hosting will help you avoid becoming a news story for the wrong reasons.

      All too often, mobile development is not for the casual developer. Creating an app that works well on iOS and Android can be a time-consuming process, requiring separate teams of programmers for each target platform with different frameworks, languages, and programming tools. This is made worse by the trend toward highly customized user interfaces. Fortunately, Flutter is an SDK that puts the power to create beautiful, customized, cross-platform mobile apps back in the hands of every developer. In this session we will live-code a mobile app on stage to highlight how easy and fast it is to develop with Flutter, while showing off the latest new features. Flutter allows programmers and designers to experiment and play with their app’s user interface; new features can be added quickly and tested immediately; and the resulting app runs at 60 fps on both iOS and Android, while keeping the look and feel for each platform.

      When you build a backend to a web app or mobile app, you want to focus on your business logic, not on your infrastructure. At the same time, you want the infrastructure to always be there for you, ready to run your code. Google Cloud Functions does that for you. In this talk, we will follow the story of the fictional startup "In Jest", publishers of an app that tells jokes. At first, the developers at "In Jest" need to get a minimum viable product up and running in an hour. As their business grows they will have to integrate with Google Sheets, SQL databases, analytics systems, marketing systems and so on. We will see the code used to make this happen, without having to worry the team about servers and data centers.

      React Native is advertised as a framework for developing native apps with javascript. Roughly 90% of the time, my team is able to work strictly in javascript, with only occassional trips into native code. In particular, my team has found our Android build to require more care than its iOS counterpart. This talk will look at the ways in which we have learned, sometimes the hard way, how to develop a react native app for Android, as well as my experience as a javascript developer being thrust into the native world. In particular, I will discuss our use of the react native device detection package to work through our Android style audits and ways we have worked around react native's shortcomings.

      Dependency Injection seems like this SUPER complex topic that only the most senior developers understand. At the end of the day, it’s just “inversion of control” where instances of objects/classes are provided to you, instead of created by you. Kotlin’s language features allow us to do this concisely, without a library, and in this talk I’ll show you how to DO IT YOURSELF. This talk will demystify dependency injection and help you understand the huge benefits it provides for testing, maintainability and modularity.
