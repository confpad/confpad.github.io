      Do your customers and your prospects have an accurate image of your company values and strengths? Branding is not your business name, logo, or color scheme. Rather, your brand is how others perceive your business. This talk will help you build a successful brand image for your company. We'll explore brand consistency beyond just the logo and colors, and help you take control over how your customers view your brand. When your current and potential customers have a clear grasp of your brand, they will in turn become brand advocates for your business.

      Nonviolent Communication is based on the idea that all human beings have the capacity for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they don't recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs.Especially in our technological industry, there are many chances for miscommunication which can lead to all parties feeling dissatisfied. Unspoken expectations, ignored feelings and accusatory or aggressive language can bring an otherwise productive team to a halt. This presentation will show you how to be aware of yourself and how your actions affect others, and how to deal with and understand others that may be negatively affecting you.

      If the tech industry can set the standard for inclusive working environments and a diverse workforce, then it’s going to have a positive ripple effect on the economy as a whole. In the past, experts blamed the American education system for failing to provide women and minorities with the type of instruction needed for future careers in technology-driven fields, thereby causing a lack of quality applicants in selected science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM”) occupations. Experts also opined that women and minorities self-selected away from STEM fields, contributing to a lack of diversity in the tech industry employment pipeline. Based upon that thinking, tech companies have focused diversity initiatives on efforts intended to increase diversity within the talent pipeline. This talk will represent the recent findings and look into what exactly the tech industry will look like in the future.

      - Design as a whole encompasses many aspects of our daily lives, and can at times be seen as a largely subjective practice.But did you know there is scientific rationale/proof for how we physiologically and psychologically process experiences, and that these considerations influence product design decisions (whether or not we are aware of them)?

We'll survey the best of Sci-Fi to learn the 3 laws of ROBOT interface and explore how to construct GREAT VUI.

      When outcomes are critical and timelines are tight it's important that we move with speed and agility. Which means that it's equally important that we don't slow ourselves down with rework or waste our effort by chasing unexamined assumptions or dismissing the possibility of failure.I propose to arm you with the ability to discover hidden truths and act upon them to best effect. I shall reveal to you the deepest secrets of success and unnaturally prolonged relevance. I will teach you magic - but perhaps not in the way you expect.
