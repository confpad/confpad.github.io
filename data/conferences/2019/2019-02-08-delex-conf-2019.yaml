      The development of Selenium 3 is officially discontinued. The next major version of Selenium 4 is being prepared for release. New commands that have been recently added to the W3C WebDriver standard will appear. A lot of legacy code will be removed, including the driver for “old” versions of Firefox. But the main changes will take place in Selenium Server and Selenium Grid. In short, the server will be completely redesigned, the new implementation is written from scratch. Yes, communication protocols will remain old, but the internal device will change beyond recognition. In particular, if earlier Selenium Grid consisted of two types of nodes (hub and end nodes), the new version will have four types of nodes. In my report, I will try to explain why we changed everything, who will get better from this, what will be the possibilities for customizing the grid in the new version and how to migrate from the old version to the new one.

      Automated Testing cannot be overemphasized in good DevOps practice but it seems that less attention is paid to it when it comes to Automating infrastructure provisioning, By working with automated RSpec testing of our real infrastructure systems, I have bee able to reduce the uncertainty around the operating environments, and also reduce the amount of manual correctness while provisioning new infrastructures and I will like to share this knowledge amongst other DevOps engineer out there, because I realize it is not a common practice

      Today, when more than half of Internet traffic in the world comes from mobile devices, the question of effective testing for mobile platforms is more acute than ever. Last summer I showed new Docker images for testing mobile web and Android applications using Selenoid. In recent months, I have been approached by many people with questions about how and for what purposes these images can be used and what are the limitations. In this report, I would like to elaborate on that.

      Step by step functional programming (or some part of it) became a daily routine of almost every software developer. At the same time, there might be an opinion that “monads” and “pure functions” are just toys for bored matured engineers. And testers should not look there for sure - they should test software, it doesn’t matter how it’s written. In my talk, I want to show that functional programming has a clear impact on software quality. Lots of defects will not even appear in the code which is written functional way. If you are interested not only in testing and finding bugs but also in conditions how to prevent them from the beginning - come to listen to my speech. We’ll check examples written in Scala working on JVM but Java or C# knowledge is more than enough to understand the material.

      Elasticsearch - being an integral part of the Elastic Stack - is known for its full-text search and analytics ability. Elasticsearch is running on tens of thousands of nodes world-wide, so despite all the functionality squeezed into new releases, we also have to think about security, all the time. This talk will cover different aspects of Elasticsearch, explain some features and (sometimes unpopular) decisions and the reasoning behind.

      Every test automation engineer probably faced with the problem of stability of the locators and with the needs of their frequent correction when updating the product. This routine work could be automated. There are some well-known solutions for self-healing test automation, like Mabl, testim.io, Applitools but they are not suitable for most kind of projects and has obvious disadvantages. There is a new idea how to make more universal solution that is compatible with any project. Im going to tell you about the proof-of-concept of this idea and how it differs from the existing solutions. At what stage of development we are now, what problems we faced and what is the ultimate goal.

      In a world of testing pipelines, when we need to run tests against every code change, the problem of sustainable, comprehensive and variative data starts to arise. Testing data, which in the maximum approximation can repeat all the conditions available in the production, in order to cover as much as possible those conditions that are critical for business and have a clear presence in the production. The subject of test data management is quite extensive, so we will try to understand it in order. Starting from the stage of obtaining secure production data, to virtualization and synthetic generation. And let's look at examples of how to prepare data production for test environments, and analyze the example of an open-source application, as it can be implemented for your project.

      DevOps is often only tried within the IT Department or, worse, within the SOFTWARE development Department. As our experience shows, this approach takes a lot of resources, but gives only minor improvements in the speed of delivery, SOFTWARE quality and other non-functional characteristics. As part of the report, we will try to take another step "up" to look at the SOFTWARE delivery process from across the organization and discuss what can be done to ensure that the implementation of DevOps does not become a cargo cult.

Several companies, development and product teams have achieved quite impressive results in this area making cultural changes, transforming their processes and practices, introducing new roles, tools and techniques.Do you think is achievable for you team or it's still a bunch of drama? There is no common approach for measuring achievements and understanding how much DevOps'ich the current team/company is. In this talk I will provide attendees with basic checklist to start with and some reliable tools/techniques to monitor progress of “DevOps transformation”.

      Maintaining a well known open source stack is no easy task. Despite fixing bugs and adding features, releases need to be aligned among products and each product needs to be tested on its own. This talk starts at the lowest level of Elasticsearch, explaining how we run unit tests, moves up to integration tests, packaging tests, backwards compatibility tests, performance tests in testing phases – all of this on different operating systems and JVM versions. Attendees will get to know how our CI looks and how all of our products (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Beats) are released at the same moment in order to ease the upgrade process for our end users.

      It’s always been a problem of mine to understand what code coverage reports want to tell me. Couldn’t wrap my head around this one particular number they come up with, the percentage of code covered with tests. Is the current percentage ok? Should it be higher? Is 80% enough or should I do something to reach magical 100%? I had to find answer to those questions while working on major refactor of a system. The problem was, is the coverage good enough to give green light the refactor. To answer the question I decided to first look at the coverage from the very most low level. Looked at the lines that are and aren’t covered. Driving the analysis with risk. Assume that all types of automated regression tests you have in your project cover 80% of your production code. This coverage is assured by unit tests, API level tests, webdriver tests and other system level tests. Besides knowing 80% of code is covered with a test, the number also tells you that 20% of your code is missing any test. Now switch from percentage to number of lines. In my case, the system we were about to refactor consisted of over million of lines of code. One fifth of a million is a lot of code missing coverage… a lot… but… not every line is equal in value and thus equal in risk. So what was the value and risk associated with each line missing coverage? One way of looking at risk is by the probability of something unwanted occurring multiplied by the impact it causes. Missing test for a line of code is definitely a risk. Nothing will tell you when the line is wrongly modified and that the modification is going to cause a bug in production.

We share discoveries on what helped them to overcome the bottlenecks and how they plan to deliver even faster. Using this we define some unifying themes on what areas provide the greatest return on investments of time and resources.
