    Do not confuse HolyJS with frontend conferences - there are many such in Russia. But until 2016 there was not a single conference on the most popular in the world (according to GitHub and RedMonk) programming language - JavaScript, which is most often associated with the frontend.

      JavaScript conference HolyJS 2016 Moscow December 11, 2016 What helps a developer to become a professional? Constant reading of articles, tweets and attend thematic conferences? Coding 24/7? Or maybe it is something else, not related to development in general? When viewers look at the work of a professional magician, they concentrate on one thing and do not notice that it is at this moment that the focus occurs - the main action hidden from the eyes. So the developers, being in the context of the tasks being solved at the moment, have neither the ability nor the desire to go beyond these tasks. Developers do not want to learn related disciplines, such as design and UX, do not want to hear about users and psychology at JavaScript conferences. Developers simply do not consider this necessary. The title of the report “debugger;” is not just a command, known to any javascript developer. This is not a breakpoint in the code. This is the opportunity to stop and understand the focus, finally see what is happening around. But unlike the code, a debugger will be launched in this report; for ourselves.http://bit.ly/2P4jIYM

      JavaScript conference of HolyJS 2016 Moscow December 11, 2016 We created excellent frameworks for client JS and backend. But between them we use old AJAX and REST. They served us well before, but web applications are becoming more complex. Andrei Sitnik, creator of PostCSS and Autoprefixer, will consider new ideas in connection between the client and the server, which he wants to build in his new open-source project. How can we take the ideas of Relay and Swarm.js and develop them? How to synchronize the log of operations will reduce the amount of code and give out-of-the-box auto-update and offline editing support?

      Here you are coding away, when you realize you are in desperate need of a quick shell script to get your project cleaned up. You are standing at a fork in the road: Bash or Node? You choose the road less travelled by (for some reason) — Node. Irina congratulates you on this decision. You have written it, you may have published it, and it certainly works. But what now? Is this all a command line module Node is good for: a project clean up and some data manipulation?JavaScript conference of HolyJS 2016 Moscow December 11, 2016 Sooner or later, there is a need for own tools for various reasons: either there are not enough ready-made tools, or there is some peculiarity in the project. Developing browser-based tools is a daunting task. The most difficult thing is for them to work remotely, off page. This is scary for many - you need to do a lot and understand a lot. But if most of the problems have already been solved, and you can focus only on the main function of the tool? What if such tools can work in an arbitrary WebView, be it embedded in a browser, editor, or other application on any device?

    description: |-
      Ensuring bug-free code in JavaScript is challenging, even when devoting considerable resources to testing, and this is partially due to fundamental elements of the JavaScript language design. As an alternative to JavaScript, the Elm language alleviates these issues by incorporating the essence of libraries like React and Redux while adding the advantages of pure functional programming and type inference. This results in code with increased reliability and maintainability, and furthermore yields an improved developer experience. Using own experience from months of building real world components, Tereza will explain why Elm’s design guides you towards well-architectured apps, sharing code and insights, so you can get an impression of the Elm life, while arming you for the gotchas you may encounter in the quest to make your life one too.

      JavaScript conference HolyJS 2016 Moscow December 11, 2016 What helps a developer to become a professional? Constant reading of articles, tweets and attend thematic conferences? Coding 24/7? Or maybe it is something else, not related to development in general? When viewers look at the work of a professional magician, they concentrate on one thing and do not notice that it is at this moment that the focus occurs - the main action hidden from the eyes. So the developers, being in the context of the tasks being solved at the moment, have neither the ability nor the desire to go beyond these tasks. Developers do not want to learn related disciplines, such as design and UX, do not want to hear about users and psychology at JavaScript conferences. Developers simply do not consider this necessary. The title of the report “debugger;” is not just a command, known to any javascript developer. This is not a breakpoint in the code. This is the opportunity to stop and understand the focus, finally see what is happening around. But unlike the code, a debugger will be launched in this report; for ourselves.
