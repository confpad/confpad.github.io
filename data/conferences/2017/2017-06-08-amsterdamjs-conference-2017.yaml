      When you look at the JavaScript world these days you can get disheartened.On the one side there is an overwhelming offer of things you should know.but are "considered harmful" by the time you have a chance to look at them.

      Assuming everyone uses the web with a 10 Mbps connection and a Macbook Pro it's rather utopian. At Udacity we have a daily traffic of millions of page views from people all around the globe and we always aim to serve the best experience possible even if you're browsing the sites with an old Android with a 3G connection. We'll see what critical steps we follow to make sure we are making our sites as fast as possible.

      The JavaScript language gets ever more powerful, but more complex to implement and deliver good performance. V8 has a new compiler pipeline and a unified approach to collecting feedback about your application. I’ll explain how we do it and present some problems. For example, in complex systems, facile "solutions" often distort the environment in unexpected ways. Welcome to the jungle *__*.

      Let's talk about security. We can all agree it is very important, however the general feeling about it is that it's a difficult and intimidating area to approach. Furthermore, is very often seen as something only backend-related, however front-end plays an important role as well.

      Virtual DOM is generally considered to give the best performance for web applications. How can this be given it is such an inefficient algorithm? I will give an overview of popular Virtual DOM implementations and I will introduce our Virtual DOM library, MaquetteJS. I will also show how Virtual DOM makes unit testing easy. I will demonstrate how we achieve 100% code coverage on all our visual components using fast-running NodeJS unit tests.

      Mobile web apps represent a large share of the Internet today. However, they still lag behind native apps in terms of user experience. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are a new technology introduced by Google that aims at bridging this gap, with a set of APIs known as service workers at its core. In this talk Ivano presents an empirical study that evaluates the impact of service workers on the energy efficiency of PWAs, when operating in different network conditions on two different generations of mobile devices. This talk presents the results of the first empirical investigation on PWAs, showing that the PWA and service workers technology is promising in terms of energy efficiency.

      Refactoring or changing an API of a lib you maintain might not be a fun task. But sometimes it is required. If you are going to do it anyway, you don't want to do this manually anyway. So with the power of ASTs & codemods you can automate this & have confidence in the result.

      The new kid on the block in browser land is WebAssembly. It allows precompiled code to run at native speed, connected via JavaScript to your browser. But how does it work? What are the (dis)advantages? Can we optimise our SPA with it? With many examples, I will talk you through the setup, pitfalls and rough edges.

      Managing state in large application applications is hard. Managing async behavior is even harder. Let's talk about why reactive programming is awesome and how it can help with managing complexity, data and scaling your applications. Also, remember the callback hell?! Well, we once have been PROMISED that all will be good. And guess what, we OBSERVED we can do better. Let's deep dive into how observables are much better than promises.

      This talk is about makepad (http://makepad.github.io), an experimental livecoding environment which renders every UI pixel using webGL and runs multithreaded. Makepad compiles JS to run on the GPU which opens up many powerful angles to styling and datavisualisation. In this talk i will showcase the editor, rendering architecture and goals of Makepad: find the fun of programming.

      Typescript was warmly welcomed with all our developers from C++, Java and C# background. So it was only a question of time for our public JavaScript SDK to be completely rewritten in Typescript from scratch. In my talk I will focus on good and bad things that we experienced during development, and will tell how our initial thoughts played out.

      Creating a stable and reproducible development environment can be a hassle. The more components you have the less feasible it becomes to run them all together on your laptop. Using Vagrant helps with reproducibility and isolation but putting all components on a single VM is very different from the way they will run in production. Docker comes to the rescue with lightweight containers that isolate each application component with minimal overhead.

      In the global OSS community, it often takes a time to solve users' problems, due to the differences of the time, language, environment and something the other things. The important thing in order not to waste time is to reduce the number of conversational balls at the issue thread. Daijiro will explain what we can do for them by referring to localization communities, tools, and npm doctor.

      Not a Data Scientist, still a JavaScript enthusiast? You are in luck: I’ll be demoing a web application built on top of Microsoft’s new Custom Vision API. It allows you to train your images either programmatically or via a GUI, and with those REST endpoints you can easily add Artificial Intelligence to your (web) application.

      The asynchronousity is inevitable. Managing async things might be messy as we don’t know neither when nor even whether the async action takes place.There are a lot of techniques for handling asyncronousity. Let’s align them and point out the main principles of designing the async data flow. Respecting these principles won’t make you spend weekends debugging.
