But to make that happen, the architecture had to be reconsidered from the ground up. In this talk, I'll break down the new concepts and explain what makes it seem faster.

    JavaScript is evolving quickly. The ES6 specification was released back in 2015 and has been implemented by modern browsers. New versions of ECMAScript will now be released on a yearly basis. We can leverage ES6 and functionality slated for future versions right now to write even clearer and more concise React code. Experience with React will help you get the most out of this session, but you don’t have to have a JavaScript black belt to leave feeling confident in using ES.next with React. Learn how to write cleaner code using the spread operator, destructuring, new async functions, and other features being introduced into ECMAScript. Oh, and don’t worry if you don’t understand all of those terms — you soon will after this session!

    Redux has become the defacto way to manage state in React— yet, there's a new kid on the block that is seeing promising growth and adoption: Mobx. The goal of the talk is to explore a thorough and balanced view on Mobx vs. Redux for state management. They both have distinct mental models for handling state (i.e. Functional vs. Object-oriented and Reactive, Mutable vs. Immutable, Plain objects vs. Observables, Single-store vs. Multi-store, Normalized state view vs. Nested state view, etc.). And naturally, the opposing mental models each have their benefits and tradeoffs — so how do you pick? While the choice is somewhat subjective, we'll discuss a few objective factors to consider. We'll also look at a few concrete examples for which scenarios it makes sense to choose Redux vs. Mobx vs. Something else vs. Nothing at all (i.e. React setState).

    Integrating React Native with a large existing native codebase can prove to be very difficult. Use of React Native generally falls into two categories: "Green Field" and "Brown Field". "Green Field" apps are built from the ground up with 100% React Native, and "Brown Field" apps integrate React Native into an already existing codebase. Integrating React Native into Airbnb's main app has been a great learning experience, and I will share the various hurdles we've had to overcome in the process of building over 100 screens in React Native across dozens of engineers, shipping to millions of users.

    The async nature of the React Native bridge incurs an inherent performance penalty, preventing JavaScript code from running at high framerates. Modern animation libraries, like Animated, address this by minimizing passes over the bridge. User interactions, where UI continuously reacts to the user's gestures, are a step further. How can we run those at 60 FPS?

    React Native brought the web’s enviable development patterns like hot module replacement and Redux action replay to mobile, without needing to sacrifice native UI. In this talk, we will take the idea further to explore some more interesting developer workflows. Starting by looking at the internals of React Native debugging, we will take advantage of Node's built in Time Travel Debugging feature to jump back and forth between React Native call stacks. We will then leverage React Native's unique event model to mirror user gestures across multiple devices and use it to simultaneously test our app across various form factors. Once the app is written, we will set up an automated continuous deployment pipeline to quickly build, test and distribute our app, powered by Code Push and Visual Studio Mobile Center. In each of these cases, we will se

Technical benefits include fast installs (since it's just a web page), push notifications, caching page content, delivering a faster feeling experience, and keeping the user logged even when the network drops a connection. By using JS plugins and libraries such such as offline.js and offline-plugin, and browser technologies such as Service Workers, IndexedDB, and AppCache, you can be sure your users will be able to use your web app even as their internet connection drops off.
