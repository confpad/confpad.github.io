      Designing an elegant interface for developers to communicate with your Android app is crucial for building a mobile platform. Ty has been building mobile-focused developer platforms at Evernote, Twitter, and now Uber. In this talk, he'll walk you through many of the best practices that he has accumulated and you’ll find out how to allow third party developers to seamlessly interact with your users’ local data to shortcut more expensive server operations. Topics will include building single sign-on, surfacing your local databases, constructing well-defined Intent interfaces, using deep links, and binding services for programmatic communication. Ty will walk you through how to create a well-defined interface in your app – if that’s something you want to know, don’t miss it!

In this talk, we will deep dive into the concept of launch screen, discover how to measure, debug & optimise them efficiently, and learn more about how to implement them correctly. In other words, this talk is all about discussing for ±45 min about screens displayed less than 5 seconds.

      "An application without tests is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to fall on. We do not teach you anything. In any case, we hope so. Are you fed up with replaying the same scenarios by hand, tirelessly repeating the same sequence of clicks, scrolls and flings to make sure that your favorite application always works perfectly? You need cream in your coffee: automated functional tests. In 2014, we jumped into the wagon of functional tests on Android. We had a real gain in making these tests understandable by the job. We will present our feedback on the technologies that allow to perform such tests (Calabash, Cucumber, ...), their integrations in our application and within our build chain. And to finish our advanced on the subject, and the pains to which you will have to prepare yourself ..."

      When we want to do more, we often hear that it takes ... 1 developer more! Then as the team grows, you can quickly spend more time coordinating than developing. An important volume of code is produced and it quickly becomes essential to ensure the coherence of the architecture, the functionalities, the components ... Then, our developer of more which appeared a priori like the solution does not increase proportionally the velocity of the 'team. Pity! With 13 Android developers spread across 5 Feature Teams, all developing on the same application, our daily lives can look like a human and technical challenge. In other words, we had better find the right answers to these problems. We will be happy to share with you our organization and the proven solutions of our community of practice. In particular, we will detail our approach to proofreading code to transform it into a moment of sharing and elevation of the collective level. We will also see how the Feature Flipping allows us to streamline production, lighten the maintenance of our branches and ensure the quality of the application.

      The migration of RxJava 2 started in 2016. But 2017 will be its flagship year and will be able to take advantage of the path already traced by its previous version. What are the changes made by this new version, in terms of API or performance? How are RxJava and RxJava 2 different? Should I migrate to RxJava 2 right away? This lecture will give a brief history of these libraries before answering these different questions.

      Being the only developer in a project can be frustrating, everything falls into your shoulders and it's very easy to get trapped into bad habits. You are not alone! There are many tools, practices and services that will make your life easier... and efficient! Several months ago I joined Help Scout as the only Android Developer with the main purpose of building their Android application from scratch. Coming from an agency environment where there were more than 30 developers willing to discuss and present different ideas, it's been quiet a challenge. This talk shares my experience, explaining what tools, practices and methodologies I've followed. Being the only developer is no impediment to build great quality code, follow good design patterns and delight your users. How to do Pull Requests, Code Reviews, Design Reviews, Continuous Delivery and Integration... Wether you are a one man band or work with a team, these tips will help you become a better programmer!

      "It all starts from a business need: to optimize or to propose a new user experience initially available for a Meetic application functionality but, on a longer-term vision, potentially accessible from another feature or even another application. We naturally oriented ourselves towards the implementation of libraries in our project. The benefits found were beyond our expectations. In addition to our need for reuse, big productivity gains soon came to us. The launch time of unit tests has become short enough to work in TDD. And the use of static data in a demo application has greatly reduced deployment time. So much so that we now design a lot of our features in this mode of development. This presentation will show you that using modules is a way to increase your productivity on large projects of tens of thousands of lines of code. It will also be an opportunity to discuss the issues we have encountered (dependency reversal, ...)"

      "Android has a wealth of open source libraries covering everything from network clients to UI frameworks. Something that is missing is a library to help load data from multiple sources, particularly 2 levels of caching + network. NY Times has recently open sourced such a library built on RxJava, Guava + OKIO which will dramatically simplifiy the common task of “get from mem cache, if not there get from disk, if not there hit the network, parse and update cache“. I'll be taking users through the problems that we tried to solve and the solution that we propose for it. The library is Store NYTimes/Store. Stores dramatically simplify data loading and caching while being exposed through reactive interfaces. Stores are the foundation of the NY Times app and allow us to both have best in class startup time as well as allowing us to work offline. In this talk I'll introduce the library and then go through the open source tools we used to build it. Topics will include: Streaming data from OKHTTP using BufferedSource/Sink, Creation a blazing fast file system. Using Guava for intelligent caching, leveraging RxJava for combining and transforming multiple data sources"

      Most Android UI testing talks focus on how Espresso works and how to start writing simple tests. This is fine for a simple app but maintaining and expanding those tests gets harder as the app grows. This talk will focus on writing complex tests scenarios while making sure we keep them maintenable, extandable and readable. I’ll use a released app we developed as an example. This will involve multi-screen scenarios, handling asynchronous operations, providing a fake environment as well as some common and less common Espresso gotchas.

      "Does your Android application work perfectly in offline mode? For Virtuo, it's essential. Virtuo is the French start-up that offers a new car rental experience. Everything is done from a mobile: account creation, booking, inventory and opening of the car. Thanks to that, no more at the ticket counter to get his key back. Because we are not afraid of challenges, our customers never have a key and use their smartphone or smartwatch to open and start their vehicle for the duration of the rental. And it works, since Virtuo already has more than 7,000 days of rentals that always start in the same way: in the basement of a car park, without access to 3G. On the program: BLE: The only quick and really offline solution HTTP cache: Do you know the max-stale header Synchronization and conflicts: Which strategy to adopt Reactive programming: Why it helped us to improve UX / Design: How a banner allows improve the experience Cache strategy depending on the context: Why can not we apply the same strategy before, during or after a reservation?"

      "Today, we hear about Deep Learning everywhere: recognition of images, sounds, text generation, etc. But, although the techniques and frameworks are being democratized, it remains difficult to see concrete applications in business, let alone mobile applications. So we decided to build a Proof Of Concept to meet the challenges of the field. We will present an example of an educational mobile application using Deep Learning for image recognition. Through this example, we will discuss the impact of this type of model on smartphones, but also architecture for the training and deployment of models. Whether you're somewhere between Data Science and Android development, there's something for everyone!"

      "After hours of watching this damn uncle, and aware that obviously, there was a better way, it was time to upgrade to the MVP. That's what we did, implementing different interpretations of the Clean Architecture on our missions, on existing applications as well as on-scratch. ((MVVM + Interactor + Kotlin) x Executor * TU + Acceptance Test) TDD = pleasure assured;). We started from Uncle Bob's postulates: to have an architecture independent of the frameworks, the UI, the back-ends and the BDDs. And above all: testable. For once, we did not put the technical stack at the center of our architectural choice. Because as he says so well, a good architect is someone who delays the choice of tools at the latest. We focused on the business rules. In pure java. In pure KOTLIN. Without libraries. This model has revolutionized the way we design an application for our different customers (BNP, SNCF, Meetic ...). We will share with you our pride, our pains and the questions that remain open. So come and enjoy young idiot! The MOB tribe, aka Uncle BOB's (r) want"

      "Do you remember the last time you had to dig into strings.xml to find the right String to use? Or that you manually had to go over all drawables to find the one you needed? Whenever we start a new project, we take a lot of care in setting up our architecture, CI, build flavors,… But do you also have a strategy to name your resources? You should! Because the lack of XML namespaces, makes managing Android resources tedious. And causes things to grow out of control easily, especially in large projects. So let's introduce a simple scheme that will solve your pains: - easy lookup of any resource (autocomplete) - logical, predictable names - clean ordering of resources - strongly typed resources. This talk will explain the mechanism, its advantages, limitations and provide an easy to use cheat sheet."

      Announced in 2014, Android Auto was the Google response to Apple CarPlay. It was however complicated for a developer to make Android Auto apps as the development tools were scarce and not really adapted. With the release of Android Auto 2.0 in November 2016, the developer has now a fully functional testing platform with Google releasing an Android Auto simulator and an Android mobile app. This new version has encouraged a growing number of constructors to include Android Auto devices in their cars, and it becomes more appealing to start developing apps for this platform, either specifically or as a spin-off of an already existing app. In this session of live coding, we will show how to use the Android Auto SDK to make a small application capable of playing songs and live streams, controllable with touch commands or the user voice. We will show what are the good practices, the functionalities and limits of the SDK while giving the opportunity for attendants to have a quick look of the possibilities offered Android Auto. A Github repository containing the code written during the presentation will be available at the end of it.

      OpenGL is often regarded as too complex, obscur or even too low level to be considered when developing an application. Most people will even try to go around it and develop what they want using Views and Canvas to avoid developing with it. Nevertheless, it's not always possible nor the best solution. As someone who have been going through all the learning of OpenGL recently, I have encountered a lot of frustration but also a lot of “aha!“ moment. In this talk, I will try to demystified OpenGL and share the basics of what it is and how to use it in Android to make applications perform better. Also, I will share all the pitfalls and key concepts that you should know when starting with OpenGL.

      Notifications are one of the essential elements of Android applications. Indeed, they are a very interesting entry point for your users and can bring a real added value if they are used correctly. In this talk, we will start with a bit of history and context, especially about their evolution during the Android versions from a UX and design point of view. Introduced in version # 1 of Android, they are often underestimated and misused. We will then see how to be a good citizen of notifications based on concepts such as category, relevance and legitimacy. Finally, we will cover a series of tips & tricks to perfectly match their uses to the needs of your users. By addressing topics such as multi-device management, triggering and the framework's unrecognized APIs, we will take a real look at their possibilities and associated best practices.

      You find RoboGuice simple but slow? And you think Dagger 1 & 2 are fast but complex and bloated? Toothpick is the best of both worlds! Toothpick is a scope tree based, runtime but reflection free implementation of JSR 330. It is pure Java, with a special focus on Android. Toothpick is fast (even faster than Dagger 2 in some cases!) and is simpler to use, with less boilerplate code. Its syntax is very close to Guice. It supports named dependencies, lazy dependencies, providers, and has built-in support for custom scopes. As compared to Dagger 2, Toothpick provides more powerful testing support, allowing you to leverage DI to mock dependencies using either mockito or easymock. Its explicit scope tree helps developers to build more robust apps. It provides more fine grained control to easily implement complex user flows that span multiple activities or state preservation across configuration changes (e.g. rotations), a common issue when implementing the MVP pattern. During this talk for experts, we will introduce Toothpick, its main features and how it compares to other DI libs. We will explain how Toothpick scopes and scope annotations can solve advanced use cases.

      Kotlin is a language developed by Jetbrains. Its version 1.0 (production ready) was released early 2016, making a buzz in the Android community. Today in version 1.0.6, and soon 1.1, Kotlin continues to arouse a keen interest. In ekito, we have been working on this language for more than a year, and today we are no longer hesitating to launch production applications with Kotlin. This session proposes to discover this language, which includes some aspects of groovy or scala, and which is very close to swift in syntax and concepts. We'll see how Kotlin boosts the productivity of Android application development and why you can not live without it;)

      "Let's be honest: there is very little chance that you will ever have a professional project on Android Wear. On the other hand, learning Android Wear can help you dramatically improve your native Android skills, and make you a better Android professional developer. This is the conclusion that I could make after developing several dials on this platform. During this talk, I'll explain everything you need to know to understand Android Wear, starting with the constraints of the platform. Then there will be a step by step explanation to make a very nice dial, all only via draw and canvas operations, without using any image. Did you think that radians, shaders, radial gradients, canvas, paths, Xfer modes, and other quadratic curves were super galley concepts? In reality these concepts are very simple and at the end of this talk, you will be able to understand them and use them in your Android applications to make super beautiful custom views or even animations."

This talk introduces a modified version of the Model View Presenter (MVP) architecture that organizes your code to be more flexible, maintainable, and testable. Using classic software design principles and modern code examples we will explore the topics of clean architecture and testability on Android. This talk covers all levels of the test pyramid including unit, integration, and UI tests. Other topics will include unit test rules, naming conventions, presenter lifecycle, persisting state, testing concurrency, mocking strategies, and working with legacy code.

Protecting its applications against reverse-engineering is something that should be done systematically before opening to the general public: Unfortunately, this step is still too often neglected. While obfuscating its code allows, to make the understanding of your system more difficult for a third party, to avoid the theft of your intellectual property and to limit the leakage of information. The purpose of this presentation is to introduce you to the obfuscation of an SDK or an application, to introduce you to the different issues and to prove to you that activating proguard is not always synonymous with crash! François and Renaud will show you step by step and in a practical way how to obfuscate an application starting from scratch, while analyzing the result and the quality of it. More advanced techniques will also be presented, the aim being to make the most of the various tools available to us for free. The limit of free tools versus paid tools will also be discussed."

All of these concepts, and many more, are possible thanks to the Nearby API. Before, it was often easier to have one phone talk to another around the world than one in the same room. Now the Nearby API greatly simplifies the process of proximity-based communication between phones, and of working with beacons. It’s easy for you to become a pro at handling proximity in your apps! We’ll go over ideas of what the Nearby API can add to your app, how to implement it, and what Google doesn’t tell you about the Nearby API. We’ll also be able to try some apps hands-on together to see the potential firsthand! There will be a smorgasbord of interesting information. Bon app-etit!
