    We launched JSFoo in 2011 as India’s first JavaScript conference. The JS community in India has grown phenomenally since then. JavaScript now pervades every aspect of web development – browsers, apps, front-end, backend, mobile and IoT, and there’s always scope to understand new ideas and solutions. The conference explores new ideas, implementing innovative solutions, and learning from experiences, especially negative ones!

      The web is evolving at light speed and all the web applications are trying to catch up. It has become very difficult for a new developer or even an existing developer to decide which Framework or Tool to choose for his next project. Angular, React, Ember, Vue are few of the myriad of options available, and some time evaluating few of these for the best fit is unending.All the browsers have come to a stage where they are almost implementing most of the new Web Standards and now developers do not need to invest much time in Browser Compatibility. Although all the front end frameworks like React, Angular, Vue & Ember have different core architectures but they are converging on a common principle design pattern i.e. Component Driven architecture. Web Components with the customElements v1 API released on most popular browsers are the solution to take standardisation of the web to the next level.

      Hackers are everywhere! Are they also in your client-side code? What do attackers target when they are breaking JavaScript frameworks and libraries? How are they stealing those elusive crypto keys and your authentication protected data?Detecting and exploiting JavaScript security issues can easily become complex since the scope for attack would be constrained by features built into the framework and libraries. Allowing external resources to be loaded via Content Delivery Networks, improper dynamic parsing of user input, using 3rd party widgets and extensions can all lead to security troubles.This talk will take the audience through multiple case studies of JavaScript framework/library bugs and the impact that these bugs would have if exploited. Real world examples of application security testing that show how we were able to bypass controls and gain access to data will also be covered. The talk will also cover some common security server configurations that can break client-side applications when implemented as is.

      Working with REST is getting difficult, having to depend on backend teams to give us the API responses in the way frontend teams want is getting painful. Tools like GraphQL change the way things work by allowing applications to raise the demand of what data they want and how they want.The challenges of working with REST. - The core principles of Demand Driven Application. - How GraphQL solves the challenges faced by REST. - Talk about the journey of building frontend applications that interact with GraphQL. - Talk about the challenges and points to keep in mind when working with GraphQL.

      A typical flow of talk would be to showcase following: a. A typical application having bloated webpack bundles b. Tools to analyze the bundles and how to read / understand the output of those tools. (2-4 tools) c. Based on hints / information from the tools, perform “live-fixes” / “walk through git-diff” to show how small changes in chunk definitions / import statements, etc can make big changes in your webpack bundle sizes.

      You’re probably doing something wrong if you write JavaScript for a living in 2017 and haven’t yet tried TypeScript. Whether you’re writing a back-end, front-end or a mobile app — and whether you’re using jQuery, React, Angular, Vue or your favourite framework-du-jour — TypeScript can significantly improve your development experience with its incredible tooling and refactoring support that can help you catch bugs as you type and bring sanity to managing large codebases.In this session, I’ll take you through the amazing world of TypeScript’s language features and its rich out-of-the-box IDE affordances such as cross-referencing and auto-completion, experiences that developers working with traditional statically-typed languages take for granted. I’ll also show you how all the latest ES2015/16/17 features are natively available in TypeScript with a greatly simplified configuration compared to Babel’s and how you can take advantage of static typing to auto-generate a nice documentation for your project.

      At Juspay, after spending a few years writing various payments applications, we found ourselves looking for a better way. We wanted to allow newcomer developers, designers and project managers to be able to jump in and start creating solutions to their problems, without jumping through the hoops created by the language and tools.

      JavaScript is single threaded, and your functions often needs to be run as soon as possible, but at the same time, you don’t want it to get in the user’s way.For example, you send analytics data when the user is scrolling the page, or you append elements to the DOM while they happen to be tapping on the button, your web page / app can become unresponsive, resulting in a poor user experience.With requestIdleCallback, requestAnimationFrame and a scheduler, we wil see how to schedule or put less priority/non-essential tasks in queue, and execute them without getting in the user’s way.We will also see, how to priotize tasks so that user does not feel the lag.

      Meteor is a type of full stack realtime JavaScript framework for web development. It’s free and open-source and a tidy package that makes web development easy.There is a concept of reactivity in Meteor which states that whenever there is a change in data source the clients connected to the Meteor server gets updated automatically without refresh.If you need very fast development of your applications then Meteor can be your first choice.

      My journey with Node started over 3 years ago, and I presented my initial learnings about running Node in production at JSFoo 2014. We have been using Node as our primary web serving layer since then, adding more features, more properties and most importantly, more traffic onto it. This led to the discovery of a lot of bottlenecks and a lot of late-night load tests. In this talk, I’ll be focusing on scaling a Node based web server and what kind of issues we have run into. This will include different approaches to attacking this problem like horizontal and vertical scaling. I will be taking you through the variety of resource bottlenecks you can expect to run into, like network, memory, disk and cpu. I’ll touch upon how to find these bottlenecks and what technologies you can use to solve them.

      Microservices are described as services with a few hundred lines of code. Big organizations run such micro services in 100’s and are often looked up to by engineers in startups/smaller companies, too eager to join that league. However the hard reality is that only a few startups will survive to scale and need micro services. Busting the hype, the experts are suggesting smaller companies to adopt writing modular code instead of microservices code. How do you write modular code in NodeJs and why are they better than microservices?
