      The JS world is a constant surprise. Just look at the recent years and you'll see why. The language itself is maturing and the angles from which we look at it are becoming more and more diverse. We've arrived from 10-year release cycles to yearly feature upgrades. ES2017 is upon us and together with it, a new tool that gives us time-warping superpowers, Async/Await. Come learn (almost) all there is to know about it and how you can start using it today. It's going to be fun!

      Sometimes the front-end ecosystem may seem, like riding a wild hog in a pitch black forest, it can be disorienting, full of nasty surprises, and even seasoned veterans may find it challenging to hang on. You may think, that if you don't check your twitter feed for a few days, you won't understand what everybody's talking about, but even worse, you may miss out on juicy opportunities to make your website better, faster, easier to maintain and so on. I'll talk about the basic set of technologies and techniques one needs to be able to deal with the onslaught of other technologies and ideas you're constantly being bombarded with as a front-end engineer.

      Web developers either love or hate client-side JavaScript. The proliferation of frameworks is empowering for avid followers of the JavaScript ecosystem, but often terrifying for backend developers who want to catch up. Is it really easier to write JS in 2017 than in 2007? I believe so, but only if we stop to appreciate how much the size and complexity of web pages grew in the past decade. Let's explore how to use the React component model to create a simple development process and a scalable architecture for building modern web apps.

      We can all agree that JavaScript is a trending programming language. But is this a good thing? Is JavaScript the right language to learn or to study? Can we push the language into the academic field so that students are better prepared for the jobs of the future in IT? I want to make a case here, that JavaScript forces you to go one step further in understanding what you are doing, compared with other mainstream languages that have their abstractions already built into the language. We will look at a few common patterns to establish some context and we will discuss about the dangers of abstractions and the source of the JavaScript Fatigue™.

      Abstract Syntax Trees, AST for short are a very less talked about subject in the world of Javascript. But surprisingly, almost all of the common tooling used by modern front end developers, from linting, minifying, babel-transforming, uglifying, webpacking depend heavily on the AST for reliable and standardised transformations. Learning how to use an AST is much simpler than I imagined. Here's about why ASTs are so ubiquitous and how you can make use of it to enhance your daily workflow.

      With Next.js, you can create React applications that automatically server-render, code-split and hot-reload, with no setup. This talk will explore the two most powerful new features of Next.js, static exports and dynamic imports. These allow for the creation of high-performance advanced applications, examples of which we'll demonstrate live, on stage.

      This talk is a practical introduction to production deployment of node.js applications. In this talk, I will share my journey of gaining a better understanding of managing production websites and becoming more confident in delivering solutions that scale. I will go over Node Clusters, MongoDB Replicas, Reverse Proxies, Load Balancers, CDNs and more with demos and real world scenarios of usage. With this knowledge, developers will be able to have a better understanding of production deployments and also learn that some problems can be solved without writing a single line of code.

      Call it a fronted state of the union, call it hot or not in YYYY, call it buzz-word bingo. We will talk about how Progressive Web Apps helps the web compete with native apps. How new browser features will transform e-commerce. Whats on the horizon for javascript and for frameworks? and where does typescript fit in? How will Houdini eventually change layout on the web? Whats up with the physical web or what about Internet of Things - and how are those related. Offline, PRPL, Observables, Serviceworker, push-notification, redux, web-APKs, and maybe even more… all packaged up, tree-shaken, server-rendered and served over https!

      Progressive Web Apps are the next big thing for the web. They combine the advantages of two platforms, searchability and shareability of the web with capabilities and performance of native mobile. As a result, web developers can use their favorite tools to build installable, re-engageable, connectivity independent apps, that can bring native-like performance and user experience. The Angular Mobile Toolkit makes it easy to get started building PWA. It’s developed to automate main routines and provide us with some nice tools to control the progressive app behavior. During this practical session, we'll have a look at Mobile Toolkit’s main components, and how they take our web app to the next level. With just some simple updates we’ll get installable, offline-capable, mobile-network-friendly Angular app re-engaging users by push-notifications.

      In the past few years, we've witnessed a massive increase in the amount of CSS experimentation, with ideas like CSS Modules and—most controversially—the rise of CSS-in-JS. But does mixing our styles and logic run counter to the original ideas of CSS? Does it break progressive enhancement? Most importantly, when dealing with such a boundary-defying trend, how can we ensure that the CSS and JS communities are united rather than divided?
