      One of the biggest benefits when choosing React Native is its declarative nature. Instead of laying out elements on screen manually, we tell React how our interface should look like for a given state. That, combined with React Native taking care of rendering, allows us to write things that would be hard or even impossible otherwise. One of such things are animations. Historically, we used to write them in an imperative and stateful manner. By design, these are hard to debug and - most importantly compose. In this talk we will take a look at writing animations in React Native by using Animated module.

      Redux is a strict framework. Whether you view that as a pro or a con, handling async actions can sometimes be a pain. Especially if you are using middleware such as Redux Thunk and have to chain promises. As an application grows, it's difficult to maintain and continuously test these actions. By the use of the ES6 generator function, Redux Sagas break up async actions into synchronous events. This makes it easier to test, chain actions that depend on the result of each other, and deserialize promises.

      You can use React to develop web applications, native apps and many more awesome things. And since the launch of Airbnb’s react-sketchapp in April you can also write React components that render to a Sketch design file. In this talk, you’ll learn how react-sketchapp works and, with several examples, how you can use it to improve your design and development workflow.

      In this presentation, you will learn how you can add powerful components to your React apps. You can now utilize a grid, treegrid, pivot grid, calendar, charts, and other components in your React based apps with very little effort. Plus you can manage data and respond to events using React while rendering UI controls. Learn how you can build data-intensive, cross platform applications using React and powerful components from commercial libraries.

      I would talk about some myths on Jest & Enzyme. Moreover to stop the comparison of Jest and Enzyme. Instead would focus on how they can work together to test well your React Components. The talk would focus on "How Jest and Enzyme complement each other" and can help you test React components in a better way.

      Since Apple and Google have introduced ARKit and ARCore respectively, the excitement for easy access to Augmented Reality (AR) on everyday mobile devices is exploding. So let’s take a look of how we can marry this new medium with React Native in the most efficient way. We head dive into AR by understanding our UX goals with an interactive AR stage demo (so bring your device!), identify implementation paths as well as existing and new libraries.
